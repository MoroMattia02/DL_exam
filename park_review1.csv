121747639,5,2011-12,United States,"We traveled for four days in December and were able to enjoy the Holiday decor, as well as the low crowds on Monday and Tuesday. Things we utilized that may be under the radar are the Baby Center, which has highchairs, a sectioned off breastfeeding area, and changing tables.We also used the Baby Swap option on many of the rides which was great, and allowed both my wife and I to ride the rides with our 4 year old and have one stay with our 6 month old.We had been told the best place to view fireworks was from in front on the castle, which we did one night. But we also watched from in front of Small World the second night, and there was a fraction of the people.",Disneyland_California,130
572057913,5,2018-3,United States,"I am biased. I love DisneyLand since my first visit at age ten. I am an adult and celebrated my 50th birthday last year there. I have a few Disney friends who live in California that I go with. I believe everyone should experience DisneyLand once in their lifetime. If you can   t have fun there, then you probably are a boring person. If you aren   t a    ride    person there is plenty to see and do. There are multiple tours that talk about Walt and the history behind the park. Ride the train or monorail. See the show in the air conditioned Tiki room. Eat some great food. And the easiest is just people watch. You never know what celebrities you will see enjoying the Happiest Place On Earth!",Disneyland_California,130
289232683,3,2015-7,Sweden,"We traveled with our two kids, 5 and 7years old. We knew that it would be a lot of lines to wait in so that was not a problem but there was no Disney caracters in the park at all. The 5 year old was so eager to hug Donald Duck and meet the Frost caracters we had read so much about in the broschyr. The princesses costed extra money to visit and you had to arrange it in the morning or it was full and she had no time to see us. If you go here, read the program of the day and find out as much as possible one day before. Also buy you tickets online at least one day before. We did and they cos 50    per person.",Disneyland_Paris,131
381950885,4,2016-6,United Kingdom,"bought an annual pass as it was cheaper than a 3 day pass (odd i know) and end up coming back 2 further times. Disney is great, don;t let anyone tell you otherwise and on a single trip it would be a 5 star review. after the 3rd trip you start to see the cracks, still an amazing place every child should visit in their lifetime, annual pass give you free parking and money off food, drink, shops and any other extra.top tip: go to the studio park fish and get fast pass ticket for Ratatouille as it gets very busy very quickly, they also have a single rider line which is quick too. the reason for this is that they have no photographs to sell you after the ride",Disneyland_Paris,130
235342607,3,2014-10,United Kingdom,Just had 4 day trip at Euro Disney. My teen daughter loved it! But there is a big expense involved from start to finish! Had been before but found it had got a lot more expensive then the last time I had gone (maybe because had four days stay) Big ques for rides! unless you get A fast pass Or you don't mind doing single rider que my daughter & me didn't mind this as we sometimes still got to sit together.Also long Que's in cafe's and waiting to be seated in restaurants. Beware there are some very selfish Parents too! Who like to push themselves in front of you with their child  buggies! & Not give you any gratitude Or thanks. I Don't plan a trip back anytime soon.,Disneyland_Paris,130
143879256,3,2012-10,Australia,"Travelled all the way from Australia to go here and they had Mickeys holloween party so we couldnt go in and see the fireworks and night time parade, so walked around and looked and went to go back on the thursday night YOU guess it another hollowen party so we werent allowed in again, so needless to say we arent impressed with disneyland. one would think we would of been told about this special event when we purchased our tickets...yes i am 51 and i would of liked a picture with mickey but was told a i had to come back in an hour and the 3 kids behind me got their picture taken, so i wasnt real impressed seeing i grew up with all the mickey mouse club etc....",Disneyland_California,130
418249066,3,2016-9,United States,"We went to Disneyland this week. It's been a few years since my last visit. During our current So Cal visit we also visited Knott's Berry Farm. Between the two parks, considering cost ($142 Knott's vs $300  Disney for 3 adults each park) crowds and overall experience i liked Knott's better. Disney is great....but they are quickly forgetting their past while Knott's has spent a lot of time restoring it. Added Disney will always be crowded.....different degrees of crowded......but you better like crowds. I grew up near both parks so maybe I see Disney as greatly changed, not for the better, and that alters my opinion......I still love Disney but I have heard a number near my age talk about the park catering to new fans while dump the old ones.",Disneyland_California,131
624203838,5,2018-9,Singapore,"A day in Disneyland has always been magical. When me and my friends reached Sunny Bay Station to get to Disneyland Resort, we were greeted by a Disney themed train with Mickey shaped windows. Do bring along an umbrella or poncho just in case it rains and there is no shelter. Whether you are with a family of friends, you will enjoy the experience. Most rides cater to children but there are roller coasters and thrilling rides at Toy Story section. There is 2 halal certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer's Club for muslim travellers. Do look out for the parades as kids will love it. Wear comfortable outfit and shoes if possible as the place is damn huge and require lots of walking. Highly recommended for all ages.",Disneyland_HongKong,131
259734846,4,2015-3,United Kingdom,"We visited in March and the Swing into Spring season had just started, with themed parades and shows. You must stay for the Disney Dreams closing show, it was very impressive.The queues were short on most rides while we were there from the 9th to 13th March, most of them we just walked on or used our hotel fastpass tickets.The only negative was the amount of rides closed for refurbishment with Frontier land having only Big Thunder Mountain running, everything else in the land was closed. You can check the Disney website for a list of closures, but not everything closed was listed.But that's enough of the downsides, the positives still outweigh them, it really was a magical experience, and I am still smiling despite being back home in the rain...",Disneyland_Paris,131
293187946,5,2015-5,United States,"I have been coming to Disneyland my whole life since I am only a short 2 hour drive away and my family and I have always been annual pass holders. I know people will always say it is too crowded but that is usually when people go during the peak of tourist season (summer, Christmas time, New Years etc.) or whenever there's a school break. Even if you are a tourist and have a couple of kids, just take them out of school for a couple days (I recommend on a Monday Tuesday) during the slow season and you will have a much better experience. We come here as often as we can, and I will do the same with my kids in the future! Can't wait to be back!",Disneyland_California,130
226797705,3,2014-9,United States,"We enjoyed most all the rides, quite a few were closed. Most of the rides need some updating or a coat of paint. Some of the cast members were great and went out of their way to help you and others could not care less. It seems that Disneyland has become a cash cow for the Disney company, they seem to do very little maintenance or upkeep. The Star Tours was fantastic since it has been updated, now every time you ride you can get a different adventure. Many of the rides the cast members would stop the lines while out in the heat for long periods, not sure why they were doing this. Disney needs to work on crowd control at their parks, Fastpass only goes so far.",Disneyland_California,129
154244044,5,2013-3,Belgium,"I had a great time in disneyland.We did two organised tours and so behind everything. What we thought that was only decorations seemed to be real antiquities. Every shop in mainstreet has a hidden mickey in there decor. Everywhere in the Parc you can see these hidden mickeys. In the waiting lines you also can see a lot of hidden gems. You must open your eyes while walking in the parc to see all the small details, and to notice all the hidden gems.Ofcourse we did the attractions and show also, but after doing the guided tours you watch and join the things on another way. My tip to everyone: just do the guided tours (inscription at the information hall at the entrance) you will have so much more fun",Disneyland_Paris,130
134726203,4,2012-6,United States,"Overall, it was better than I expected. The rides were longer than I thought they would be, and they were also very neat and well put together. We also met the princesses and other characters. It was nice that the princesses took the time to talk with my daughter and take a bunch of pictures. We also saw the princess show and it was fun because my daughter got to participate. I highly recommend going through Mickey's house, I thought it was amazing and I am 27 years old! We also enjoyed the Pirates Island and Frontierland. I was kind of disappointed in Tomorrowland, but the submarine ride was really neat. The only bad thing about Disneyland was the lines, I guess it is to be expected.. but it still sucked.",Disneyland_California,131
504173071,2,2017-7,Saudi Arabia,"Drove 5  hours to Paris to take kids to Disneyland. Access to park was in good organization (long walk though for kids), but the number of people was toooooo much! My kids hardly got a chance to have decent rides. Waiting times ranging between 45 minutes and 2 hours. Unfortunately, we have paid a lot to travel and get to the park only for their disappointment as they couldn't stand the long lines and the high temperatures. Why kids don't take priority in the rides? Why families with infants don't get priorities? If you are allowing to many people in, then would you increase the number of  good  attractions to split time over them?I would stick for NL famous park  Afteling  next time to have better family quality fun and time.",Disneyland_Paris,131
509336339,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,"Our first visit to disneyland and we and the grandkids loved it, we spent four days here and tried to do as much as possible but you can't it's just too tiring there's a lot of walking and a lot of queueing, if you are a disney hotel guest make use of the magic hours every day. I particularly enjoyed the star tours experience, hyperspace mountain and big thunder mountain the children loved fantasyland and all the rides there, the fireworks and laser show is worth staying up for and the parade is spectacular, if you want to buy souvenirs there beware it is all very expensive 20 euros for a small cuddly toy but at the end of the day it's worth it because it's just a magical experience ",Disneyland_Paris,130
139321783,5,missing,Australia,"We were here for 2 days with our son (almost 2 years old) at the very beginning of September. if possible try to avoid the weekends as they are very crowded. We were there for a Sunday and a Monday, Monday was definitely a bit quieter. The shows were great and you should make time to see them   our son adored the Lion King show and the Golden Mickeys. The staff were very good at all attractions and we never ad queue jumpers at all during our 2 days. The food was alright and consistent with what we expected, you aren't going there for fine dining! overall a great trip and I'd highly recommend for people with smaller children as there probably isn' too much for older kids or adults.",Disneyland_HongKong,130
556223278,3,2017-4,Philippines,"In terms of fun factor, Singapore's Universal Studios was way better.The Disney Princesses seemed unhappy while touring the grounds and being ogled by children and people.The Night Parade was a let down. At the end of it we were asking if that was it. After lining up and being jostled around by the crowd we felt shortchanged.Staff at the souvenir shops were snooty   so why would people be happy in buying way overpriced Disney stuff we could get at lower prices elsewhere?There was no ride that I could say was super fun. And I was so looking forward to the Star Wars ride which was not fun at all   is that all they could think of?Maybe we'll have a better experience in Osaka with the Harry Potter theme park...",Disneyland_HongKong,129
263311540,4,2014-5,India,"Yes, I want to play more. My wife told me we'd go to the Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast again, but we couldn't get the time. While I had to explain to her that we'd miss a lot of things if we go for Autopia, as it was a long queue. The point is, we all become kids there, I guess unless you have a kid. I really don't know how the parents there were controlling actual kids.Except for the little jerk in my back during Space Mountain 2, rest of the Disney park was something of a dreamland. The only thing one needs to know other than that probably is that it's huge, and you'll end up walking miles if you try to cover as much as you can.",Disneyland_Paris,129
423331941,2,2016-2,United Kingdom,"I've been to Disneyland in California around 8 years ago and I loved it! When my Mom told me we were going to EuroDisney, I was so excited and I thought my experience would be the same. Sadly, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. The rides are childish, souvenirs are very expensive, all the restaurants close way before the park closes, almost every ride was either broken or under construction, and I only saw 2 Disney characters throughout the entire day. We really wanted to see the closing fireworks so we had to wait for 1 hour and a half in the freezing dark cold because the rides and restaurants were shut. And the worst part was that the bathrooms were closed too! I am definitely not impressed. ",Disneyland_Paris,130
220235359,5,2014-7,United Kingdom,"We visited here with extended family and each member had a ball. The magic just never goes. Characters could be a bit more abundant but the staff that organise the specific character slots are great and make sure everybody gets their turn. The parade was super and my kids were thrilled to see Elsa, Anna and Olaf in it. Food and merchandise is quite pricey but you just have to accept that. We stayed in Disneyland Hotel so had access from 8am but not that many rides are actually open early. Careful planning is needed. We often were in for 9ish and that allowed enough time to get ahead of the gates opening at 10 to the rest of the public. We will definitely be back again and hopefully soon. ",Disneyland_Paris,130
373128151,5,2016-5,United States,"I live in Georgia, which across the country from Disneyland. I made the cross country trek for the Tinkerbell 1 2 Marathon. Now, I will adamantly defend that Disney WORLD puts on the best races HANDS DOWN. But since this is a review of the park, I'll have to say DISNEYLAND is where it's at hands down!!! The longest wait line I ever saw was 60 minutes, that's a short wait at Disney World. Most of the rides were kid (3 7) friendly. Being a kid at heart, and extremely prone to motion sickness, I loved everything about this park. The best part of all was the asessability to the Characters!! I highly recommend this park to anyone thinking of taking a younger child to the Happiest Place on Earth.",Disneyland_California,130
305983080,4,2015-9,United Kingdom,"Be prepared to spend a lot of money, the food is NOT cheap about    20 a head and nothing is offered cheaper unless packing own lunch. Smoking was happening whilst waiting in line for rides! My hair stunk at the end of the day. As for the rides unfortunately 2 rides broke down whilst I was in line meaning I only managed 4 rides in total of a 10 hour day. The rides I did get to go on were spectacular! The only one I didn't like was mission to space mountain. It is a brilliant ride but I don't like going upside down, I did not know it did this until too late... The park is well kept and clean but the toilets could use more care and hygiene. ",Disneyland_Paris,130
333987646,5,2015-12,Portugal,"A magical place in Europe. More than you could expect. Good to visit with families or couples. 5 different environments with many atractions suitable to all ages. Such a clean place (you can't see rubbish on the streets). Xmas seasons increases the magic of the place. Within 2 full days (off peak, week days) we manage to see 80% of what we had planned queueing not more than 20 minutes per atraction. The worst thing is the food inside and outside the park: too busy restaurants and not good food. It's better (if you can) to bring your own food (less expensive and quality food). Expect to pay more than 30 euros for junk food for 4 people family (i mean junk food). I would come back next week.,",Disneyland_Paris,129
135436343,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"I loved eurodisney and the Eurostar is much better than taking a plane. There was a lot of walking but it was worth it. I wouldn't recommend it for couples, maybe people who have kids and are about 7 and over because it will be easier for them to go on the rides.I stayed at Newport bay hotel, and it was amazing, the food was very tasty and clean and the rooms were lovely so I wouldn't complain about them.the rides were amazing and how they've done it is very good and fun!! If visiting Disneyland newport bay I would reccomend you to see stunts spectacular show which is so different to what you would expect in other countries.I hope you visit eurodisney and have a great time if so.",Disneyland_Paris,130
160962779,5,2012-9,Australia,"3rd trip to disneyland and i still run around like a little kid. i think every time you go you develop new strategies to see everything.As many others have said, it is quite expensive but it is always well worth it. the parades are amazing, so are the fireworks. we travelled just after american kids had just gone back to school so it was relatively quiet. didnt have to wait long in queues and having the added bonus of the fast pass helped us ride rides several times throughout the 2 days we were there.All the rides are amazing, unfortunately the indiana jones ride was not operating (one of my favourites) but ride maintenance has to happen at some time!!Always an amazing experience, no one does it better than disney!",Disneyland_California,130
139333842,2,2012-8,South Korea,"My 4th visit to this park, my first was in 1992 when it opened. Back then it was an excellent park, but per the years it has deteriorated. Even with the studio park, the old park has lots it's magic. The light parade has changed their lights and they know look cheap (where has the high standards gone), the buildings look old, the walkways, rides look tired and no new injection of enthusiasm into the park. Some of the staff are great, some good and some not so, but I understand that with such a large manpower, they can't get it all right but as Disneyland..they should. Seeing a member of staff smoking behind the fence is not what I would expect from this park, the magic has gone.",Disneyland_Paris,129
428580455,1,2016-10,United States,"Well this will be our 3 trip to California Disney park and our last , It so not worth the money , to many grown adults with NO CHILDREN wait for kids rides ! Why does grown adults of 30 plus years want to got on the tea cups or dumbo rides ... ? Or worst still que to meet Micky mouse! They make the que lengths even longer, it hard enough keeping toddles in check without having to wait for 40 mins or more for rides and to meet characters . I feel that a lot of the rides are out dated and modernisation of a lot of them is well over due ,Disney is def look old and tired, come on Disney An overhaul is well over due ",Disneyland_California,130
120856302,4,2011-2,United Kingdom,"Firstly, I'd like to praise Disney regarding their disabled access for rides. My son is autistic and without the priority shown to him with his disabled pass he should have had meltdowns in all the mad queues for rides. Unfortunately though, the Mad HattersTea Cups, Big Thunder Mountain, and Space Mountain were all being fixed when we tried to go them. They were out of action for most of the day. We were staying there for 3 days, but if you'd only had a one day pass this would have been much more annoying to find that the more popular rides weren't running at certain times. Maybe it's coincidental, but it made me wonder whether they close these rides routinely during off peak days in order to service them. ",Disneyland_Paris,129
229701871,3,2014-6,New Zealand,"First visit to Disneyland Paris. Having been to both Disneyland in Anaheim and Disneyworld in Florida I was excited to visit Paris.It was such a disappointment and I wish we had spent the couple of days we had there shopping at outlet stores... I think we would have had more fun (and I don't like shopping!).The park seems so much smaller (it was). The food in the Disneyland district outside was terrible! It was so much a less happier place than the Disneyland in USA.I felt that everyone was just going through their paces & doing there job. There was no  magic  left in these castle walls.I would not go out of my way to visit again.If you have the chance to visit the parks in the USA, grab it",Disneyland_Paris,130
345924336,5,2016-1,Canada,"This was our second trip to Disneyland. My girls were 7 and 11 on this trip. Three days was not enough so next time we'll go for 4 or 5! Every trip we learn something new and valuable!I highly recommend the character breakfast at Plaza Inn, especially if you have little ones! Minnie and friends come around to the tables and it's a delicious buffet breakfast with a lot of options.There are so many things to do! We watched s Frozen play at the Royal Hall and also Mickey and the Magical Map.I also recommend getting the Disneyland app so you can check wait times and FastPass availability. It's great as it also shows where characters are!This is our all time favorite place to go! Can't wait to go again!",Disneyland_California,130
636862975,5,2018-11,United States,"Disneyland is a place where memories are made. When you start walking down Main street, your are taken to a whole different place. A place where you can be a kid again, and you can leave all your worries behind. There is something for everyone there. If you cant ride rides that's ok because there is so much to look at including shows, parades and even train and boat rides! Don't forget the music as you walk along you might here a Jazz band playing in New Orleans Square, or a Barber Shop Quartet singing on Main Street. If you have little kids there are still rides that they can go on as well. It really is a magical place that brings our family back time and time again.",Disneyland_California,129
429656846,3,2016-10,United States,"We were staying 30 minutes away for a conference, and decided to check out Disneyland since it was so close. They say October is the off season, but it is still crowded!! A lot of the rides we wanted to ride were down for maintenance, so it was pretty disappointing. Space Mountain was decked out for Halloween, and was by far my fave ride. It was interesting to see the differences between the same rides offered at DisneyWorld and Disneyland. We did not get the park hopper pass to include California Adventure... kind of wish we would have just gone in to that park over Disneyland... newer rides and alcoholic beverages. At least I can check Disneyland (the original) off my bucket list. I highly prefer DisneyWorld, hands down!! ",Disneyland_California,129
165378934,5,2013-6,United States,"Of course it was crowded, we went the first week of summer break. My only complaint was that you could really only get one fast pass at a time. Fast passes were life savers, especially with little ones. The staff is so helpful. Use the train to take you land to land, especially after a long day. Also use the monorail to get to the restaurants in Downtown Disney and then return that way. It saves your feet a lot of walking. Early mornings and late evenings cut the ride times down. It is expensive so plan on that as well. Take your own water because you will pay over $4 for a bottle. Oh and make sure you take your littles to the restroom before getting in a long line.",Disneyland_California,131
659080088,4,2019-3,Canada,"..if you can handle the crowds. We expected busy and boy was it ever. I prefer the WDW prebooking of fastpasses and the magic bands to manage long lines and waits, but you can add MaxPass if you want to pay for it. Park is clean and well themed. All the CMs are friendly and accommodating. Tried Walt   s chilli. Didn   t get to ride in the front of the monorail but we tried. Having park hopper is nice between these two parks as they are so close together. A few rides went down a couple times but never for long. If it is your first visit and you want to see it all, I would say two days at each park. That factors in, eating, shows, parades, rides and lines.",Disneyland_California,131
483682374,3,2016-9,Singapore,"Went to HK Disneyland for my birthday and of course, I had to get a badge from the office before starting. Throughout our visit, NOT A SINGLE cast member wished me a Happy Birthday (I was quite hurt). The cast members all looked like they've been owed their wages and did not look like they were working at the most magical place on earth. It wasn't even a particularly busy day because it had rained in the morning, so we could only go in at almost noon ish. The only up side was the queues were relatively short, but that's about it. Don't think it's worth spending close to a $100 (SGD) here. Will probably be my last visit. I'd rather save more money and go to Tokyo Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong,129
553471459,2,2018-1,United States,It   s no longer the happiest place in earth but has become the slowest place on earth. Arriving by car you get the pleasure of paying $20 for parking that between the wait getting in the parking structure and fighting the crowd to get in a team takes at least an hour. Most rides take near to an hour to wait or get a fast pass and come back in 2 hours or more. While waiting for the fast pass you can   t get another. If you manage to get on a ride it lasts about 5 minutes. Spend a day there and maybe get on 4 or 5 rides. Not worth the money or time unless you   ve never been there and even then not sure it is.,Disneyland_California,129
455223531,3,2017-1,United Kingdom,"My partner & I visited here 2 days ago just for the day. Disney is such a lovely place to be! Just a bit upset as a lot of the rides were closed when we were there in both parks and then at 5:10pm we tried to go on the tower of terror and it closed at 5:00pm due to the Star Wars show going on? There was no notices anywhere saying this? We was a bit angry at this. Wouldn't recommend going in January as the park is quiet so they feel they can shut rides, a lot of the food stalls were closed too, only the restaurants were open. Basically, we've been to Disney a few times and enjoyed it but going in January I really wouldn't recommend.",Disneyland_Paris,130
219525384,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"It really is an incredible place to visit. Having been to Florida disney world I was expecting to be slightly let down in comparison but I was far from it. The Halloween decorations were brilliant as we're the harvest parades. I strongly recommend staying for the castle show at night as it really is gorgeous! So much that I ended up staying for the same show several nights in a row. It's amazing that the park is kept so clean and tidy when it is always so busy! Incredibly friendly staff and actors, we were treated the same as the children and we were a group of three twenty year olds so it was really nice that they appreciate that we are just there to enjoy ourselves as well :) ",Disneyland_Paris,130
199844756,5,2014-3,Slovakia,"Disneyland park in France is just wonderful. I cannot compare it with other Disneyland parks as this was my first visit ever, but i love it. It is very big and although there are many people everyday it is clean. In the time of our staying in the park 4 attractions were closed, but it was OK because there were many others. We spent there three days and we didnt see everything. We will definitely return back. Our children were very happy. Yes, maybe the food and shops are overpriced but you can find also some cheaper alternatives for eating. You can choose cheaper or more expensive restaurants. The only cons of this park are the queues for the attractions, we were sometimes tired and bored while waiting for an attraction.",Disneyland_Paris,131
459282404,4,2017-2,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a stay at disney we stayed at the hotel Cheyenne and couldn't fault it , we had 5 days at the Disney parks which were great the only fault I would say was I had my 1 year old granddaughter with me and I don't feel there are enough baby changing facilities in the parks I could only find one which they call baby care centres which were great and had all you would need to feed and change your baby but it would be much better if there was a couple in the parks as they are a long way from some of the rides especially when you have to walk there with a few children when the park is really busy .",Disneyland_Paris,129
228926908,5,2014-9,United States,"Appreciated the extra security steps Disneyland takes. Felt totally safe. Every single employee (and there are many) are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask for help or directions. Took a few snacks along, but also enjoyed the Disneyland corn dog, mint julep, churros, ice cream, and other tasty treats. Take advantage of the Fast Pass, which is totally simple to use. If you're not sure how to use it, there are many employees around to assist. Disneyland is such an exciting place, but take a couple of breaks throughout your day to grab a drink and or snack, find a cool place to sit, and just people watch. Be friendly and chat with some other travelers. We met many, many nice people from all over the world. Have fun!!",Disneyland_California,131
328799413,4,2015-11,Singapore,"We arrived early in the morning with tickets already purchased online. All the rides (no shopping yet) were practically covered within 4 hours. The more exciting rides were like: big grizzly mountain, space mountain, RC racer in Toy story, mystic manor...Long queues were: the many adventures of Winnie the pooh, jungle river cruise, autopia.. Watch out for the shows. Long and rowdy queues. Honestly they should have proper lines for queuing even in the waiting area before the shows start. Plenty of time to shop after the rides, even after the parade fireworks at night.

I had heard from friends that is a small park, which it is but it is definitely worthwhile and has plenty to do for the day! There are many common rides like it's a small world and the Winnie the Pooh ride however, there are some rides such as Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience that are only in HK!The park is also possibly one of the cheaper ones of the world, the ticket itself is around   60 and you can get meals for about   10. Parking is around   20 for the day.Do stay for the fireworks as they are lovely! ",Disneyland_HongKong,130

Long lines and long wait times, it would be more tolerable if they had Canopies for the waiting lines. Most times were 40 minutes or longer for rides, I realize it is peak season! Prices were high but expected this and had to make good choices about where to eat. I would have like to have seen more of the animated characters throughout the park mingling with the crowds... That is why the young children want to go the park ... To see the characters they love on TV.Parade was awesome but very very very very very difficult to find a place to watch it from. In my opinion Disney world was much better.",Disneyland_California,129

The whole atmosphere of the place was just awesome, we loved the parade and the dreams show which is on at the close every evening had me in tears every time it was just breath taking. We all enjoyed the rides and didn't find the queuing to bad but we did make the most of the fast pass option, when you go back at a certain time. Thunder mountain, buzz light year, pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Pan were most popular with us. Space mountain is great but really throws your head around!

It's my favorite place on earth, where I am reconnected with the child in me I purchased the tickets online which is highly recommended to avoid long waiting lines and sometimes to benefit from special offers they have When u enter the park, u feel like you have entered a Magical Land, this feeling is immersed with the music played in the background.The parade at 05:00 pm was amazing, you would feel like you are 5 years old again. Other than all of those adventure and adrenaline rides I highly recommend to ride  Small World  . It's very charming and delightful If you have time, it's better to get the 2 days ticket than the 1 day so you wouldn't feel rushed ",Disneyland_Paris,131

Yes, prices are extortion for gifts food drink and yes, there a long queues for rides and character meets... What do people expect when visiting one of the biggest attractions in the world?!? Can't compare to Disney USA as I have never been, but perfect to have a European version to help those like me who will probably never be able to afford the trip to USA.

I was really bummed because we had wanted to see the haunted mansion all dressed up. We still had loads of fun and they can't control the weather. Didn't realize they don't have an evening firework show except a few nights a week. Overall takeaway is I wish I would have planned better. We have been to Disney world over 10 times and there was really no comparison to it in my opinion.

Perfect for our two girls as they are 5 and 1 so we were able to see just about everything. The staff were all super nice, helpful and very friendly.

The longest line we had was a 30 minute wait, and that was out of the norm, which was more around 10 to 15 minutes. The park is always clean and the crowd orginization is the best.

One day I went and rode 2 rides and was just done getting run over by strollers and bumped into by random people and waiting in hour long lines...

The rides were accessible on the Wednesday and Thursday before Easter but it started getting worse on Good Friday and especially the day before Easter.

Every area is enchanting, so much to see and do and the extra magic hours helped a lot, going on popular rides or taking pictures before the crowds rush in.Food was ok and if well organized, even queuing can be not so painful (as we feared).I'd recommend watching the shows, they were fabulous!

I walked around for an hour trying to squeeze in to a designated spot but was continually moved on by the staff, the second one was much less crowded.

True, it tends to be crowded no matter when you go   especially on weekends   but the new Maxpass system helps level the playing field. And Disney has a way of adding additional detail or new attractions to make it worth coming back to again and again.

There are so many things to see and do at Disneyland and you can't do it all in one day visit.

Unfortunately we have been to Disneyland in America so found ourselves comparing.We went on a Thursday so there was almost no queues, although a lot of people in the park, I suspect on a weekend or holiday the place gets very busy.",Disneyland_HongKong,130
8231989,5,missing,United Kingdom,"I stayed at disney for 3 days 2 nights with all my family and it was absoloutly amazing. We stayed in the hotel cheyenne which was fantastic. The rooms, buildings and everything was cowboy themed. It was as if you were really in a cowboy ranch. The parades were fantastic. We travelled on the eurostar which was nice. The rides were really fun and some were really fast like rock and rollercoaster and space mission. Some of the queus for rides are very long so it's worth getting a fast pass. The effects of attractions in wallt disney studios were truly magical. The fantilusion parade followed by wishes fireworks was defintly magical. It's defintly worth staying as it is great fun and amazing. Also there is so much to do.",Disneyland_Paris,130
173931699,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"2nd visit in the past few years and still just as magical as the first time, watching the 20th anniversary celebrations   parades and castle show and fireworks   were amazing, tear inducing! So much to do and see make sure you book several days at least 3 I'd say to cover everything the rides are clearly labelled as to who they are suitable for and for the first time we went on the small world ride...wow...the animatronics were amazing we completely forgot we were listening to the same song played over and over in different languages, the weather was great which made it even better, the only downside is that shops and drinks are really expensive but then its Disney...its once in a blue moon (unless you go every year!)...treat the kids!!",Disneyland_Paris,131
141440650,5,2012-3,United States,"I may have grown into a fairly cynical 30 year old man, but Dinseyland still restores my faith in magic and storytelling. I've been on each and every ride dozens (some of them hundreds) of times, and I still notice new things. The details on the rides, line queues, and stores is still amazing, making you feel like you've stepped into another world. As I've grown older and learned how the sausage is made (and even worked for The Mouse for a brief period) and realized how crassly commercial some of the additions to the place have become, it's never broken my love of the place. A cure for cynicism that will remind you of childhood, Disneyland is a national treasure featuring a unique type of American art. Wonderful.",Disneyland_California,129
247312996,5,missing,India,"Amazing place, completely mesmerizing. The most courteous staff and woah this place is like a heaven not only for kids who grew up watching the magic created by Mr.Walt Disney but also for their parents who use to exercise their parental powers to stop their children from spending too much of time in front of that idiot box, lol. From the rides, to the shows, to the restaurants( we found ourselves   Indian food ^ ^ ) . Disneyland did a really great thing by installing water coolers next to the toilets at every corner of the park. Not punching a hole in the pockets of the tourists. And on top of that the firework show that happens every night at 9 is pretty intense and captivating. MUST GO   Highly Recommended!",Disneyland_HongKong,130
240506052,5,2013-12,India,"What more to say when the name brand itself is so enticing that even without reading the reviews you would go there.We went as a family and had the best time of our lives till date. Such an unforgettable memory , so much of laughter, fun, rides and what shows!Go and turn yourself into a kid again, leave behind those inhibitions and enjoy wholeheartedly as the characters there are ready to welcome you with broad smiles.The park is divided into 3 sections so only suggestion is go as early as possible preferably when the gates open and be there to watch the fireworks show at the end. Don't you miss it! That is some spectacular show there! What more to say, Seeing is Believing, so check it out for yourself!",Disneyland_HongKong,130
261200855,5,2015-3,Spain,"Having grown up on the east coast and visited Disney World many times, I wasn  t sure what to expect from Disneyland   but I was pleasantly surprised. Some parts of the park were closed for renovations, but even so most things seemed to be up and running. Though the parks are comparable, the feel is slightly different. Disneyland felt slightly smaller and less intimidating (maybe because of the areas that were closed, but I don  t think so), and we had surprisingly good luck with getting the fast passes and not having to wait more than 20 minutes for anything (our longest wait was for Alice in Wonderland, 20 25 minutes). We were happy to see not only families with young children, but people of all ages enjoying the different attractions.",Disneyland_California,131
303742950,4,2015-8,United Kingdom,"Took our three year old granddaughter for a treat and had a lovely time. The attractions she could go on we're limited so the trip was not as frenetic as past trips with our sons. The food at each of the events we attended was very good and while the service was not quite of the American standard it was good and probably better than the UK. The only slightly negative comment we would make was that we attempted to see the fireworks and closing show on three separate nights but she was not able to stay awake despite later starts and early evening naps. That said, it was probably our disappointment rather than hers but and earlier show would have been nice. Recommended for a bit of escapist fun. ",Disneyland_Paris,130
119831698,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Disneyland is a 'bubble'   the rest of the world doesn't exist. We found the map a bit useless, and couldn't find the rides to start with, but in some areas, there aren't actually that many. Disney is about the whole experience, not just thrills, and once we got this, we really enjoyed it. We saw the Disney Villains show and the Parade, which was a great way to end our visit.Queue times were long (half term) and it worth fast passing the rides that you can, or you will spend a lot of time waiting around. Nothing is cheap, and nothing is healthy, but it really is a magical place. The staff were excellent and the attention to detail is incredible. I think we enjoyed it more than the kids!",Disneyland_Paris,130
177618537,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,This is the second time we have visited Disneyland in Paris and we were disappointed on both occasions. The park is dirty and not very well kept. We queued for over an hour on 3 separate rides when they had a mechanical fault so were turned away from the rides. When you only have one day here 3 hours out of that day is a lot when you have disappointed children with you. The place is expensive and very crowded. The highlight was the 20th Anniversary Firework and Laser Display at the end of the evening which was well worth the wait. The pushing and shoving on the other hand was not very good with people ramming you with bags and buggies   no consideration for their fellow disneyland people.,Disneyland_Paris,129
547467831,4,2017-12,United Kingdom,"I have been many times to Disneyland Paris in the past and this trip was the worse of them all. It still had loads of great points, the shows and parades were excellent and nearly all the rides were open. But the big negatives were the lack of organisation at some of the parades and shows, if you didn   t want to watch just wanted to get past it was impossible, they stoped marking off path ways for people. A lot of the rides were closed for a hour a time due to break downs. A lot of the eating places were shut and nothing opened before 12 so u could have a sit down and a drink. But on a whole it was a great experience and I would return.",Disneyland_Paris,131
344133763,2,2016-1,United States,"We visited Disneyland in January with our eight year old son. My summary of the experience is:  ticket prices are prohibitively expensive, particularly if you have more than one child  the park itself if VERY, VERY crowded. We deliberately chose a  quiet day on a quiet week  and it was still ridiculously crowded. Wait times on rides ranged up to 70 minutes which is just crazy. Clearly the number of annual pass holders clog up the park making it way too busy  the rides themselves are old, old, old and need to be updated  food at the park is poor quality and expensive  if you choose to go, learn the fast pass system before you enter the park as this is somewhat helpfulWe would not recommend a visit to Disneyland.",Disneyland_California,130
336049155,5,2015-11,Canada,"Although a little overwhelming for our 2.5 year old, the fact she is still talking about meeting Mickey and Miney along with all the princesses to us as parents is priceless. Park is immaculate for the amount of people that go through it everyday. Characters and park staff are wonderfully happy all the time.Best perk for us was PhotoPass service, photographers were awesome and we got over 350 pictures over the 5 days, what a wonderful service!!!!As crowds are expected the only 'con' regarding this was the lines to get through the bag check on 2 of the days, 30 40 min to get through bag check then only 5 min to get into park. More staff needed at bag check in my opinion.Other than that what a magical place!!!!",Disneyland_California,130
601827098,5,2018-7,Oman,"We stayed in Torcy, 3 stations away is Disneyland park. We took 2 day ticket, one day park and another day studio. Better to book on line to escape long Q. Must mark all the rides before and finish the rides first as waiting in Q itself may be hour or more and if time permits to see other attractions. When you go for a ride if Q is long, there are Fast pass machines nearby, but hiding, scan your ticket you will get ride timing few hours away. According to that time you can come so that Fast pass holder Q are short. However, only one Fast pass booking can be done at a time. July was very hot, better to avoid. Studio rides are better than park.",Disneyland_Paris,129
124255085,4,2012-1,United States,"My husband and I *both in our 50's* visited Disneyland during the workweek in January.. it was so great.. hardly any lines and most attractions were open. We bought the 2 Day Multi Park Pass and on the second day we strolled around California Adventure. It was unique, and probably worth a quick stroll through too! The California Soaring ride was by far, our favorite. Incredible movie with  smell a vision  in all the right places. It just goes to show you that Disneyland is wonderful for kids of all ages. Alot of walking, but worth it at the end of the day. HINT: Save the water log ride until the end of the day and maybe consider bringing an extra change of dry clothes in a backpack! Ugh!",Disneyland_California,129
178846131,2,2013-9,United States,"how can they charge so much money to get in with how crowded it is everyday, you cant enjoy anything. if you go during and shows or events youre herded like cattle. even besides how annoying it is to be shoulder to shoulder with everyone all day, that cant be safe... my wife and i got a premium pass this past year so we got to see first hand all year round and as great as disney is, i will never get a pass again. let alone pay over a $100 to go for a day. i hope someday they find a way to bring the magic back to disneyland and not make it about how much they can charge and how many people they can unsafely pack into the park.",Disneyland_California,131
140822251,5,missing,United Kingdom,A very nice park. This is one of the smaller parks in the Disney group. It can be finished in one day if you rush it but we took out a two day pass and took our time. Staying at the Disney hotel helped.The kids absolutely loved this place. The food is very pricey but what to do?!! The waiting times were not too long. I think the longest we waited was about twenty mins.Grizzle Gulch the newest area of the park and boy what a fun roller coaster.They are adding another area to the park due to open next year I think. Its good that they are expanding.Will definitely come here again as its a good size and not too big so the kids won't get tired walking so much.,Disneyland_HongKong,131
