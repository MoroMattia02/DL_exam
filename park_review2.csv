443603874,4,2016-12,India,Bonjour ladies and gentlemen. It was a casual visit with my friends to this place. We reached this place using RER A post a visit to TOUR EIFFEL. I would rate this place slightly overpriced. It is much hyped and frankly it did not meet our expectations. Rides were thriller but the long ques and ill managed crowd is really an upset. There was not even single Mickey mouse or Cinderella or any Odr characters. And going to Disneyland studio was total failure. It was just not worth a visit a boring place to be. Disneyland charged us 60 euro (discounted fare) per head it was just not worth spending so much. Most of their rides are under renovation for some upcoming anniversary however they have not lowered their fares to tally the same. ,Disneyland_Paris,134
385411683,5,2016-6,United States,"This was my second visit to Disneyland Paris and coming from California and being close to Disneyland, I have high expectations. For the most part, it was a wonderful visit. Love the different restaurants they have including Walt's, which is a tribute to him. The workers lacked personality, and I even saw one waving and smiling at a car full of passengers about to take off on Space Mountain, and after it was launched he looked at another worker and rolled his eyes. Not impressed... That would not fly at home!! During the firework show there are ZERO workers to be found. No parade control or anything. It's a complete free frawl and people were standing and sitting in nice grass areas not meant to be stood in... Besides that, wonderful time!",Disneyland_Paris,132
148478583,3,2012-12,Belgium,"The magic is getting smaller,This was my 6th visit to this park. It seems to me that the park needs to be renovated very quickly.In the past I always enjoyed a visit but now I was disappointed. Altough I visited the park in the passed when there were many people, I was very pleased, but now  yesterday  it was a catastrophy. Several attractions, Space Mountain,Nemo, The Mining Company, Buts lightyear,Star Tours and others were several times out of duty. So it was inpossible to follow are planning and in addition of very long waiting times we lost a hole day of pleasure ( we stayed 3 days).Of course we knew there would be a lot of people, it's seems that they were not capable to handle such a mass.Sorry Disney Paris, shame on you.Positive : the beatifull laser show.",Disneyland_Paris,139
483566888,5,2017-5,United Kingdom,"Brilliant for the kids. Queues for the characters were often very long which is to be expected. Weekday queues much shorter than weekends and during meal times. Loads of rides for little people and big people and when we went in late march only a couple were still closed. Drinking Water fountains every where so we took bottles and just refilled as food and drinks on the park are expensive. Toilets always clean and plenty of them and the park was very clean. All in all we throughly enjoyed our 4 days with the kids and grandkids. Make sure you wear comfortable sensible shoes as there is a lot of walking and standing around. Fireworks and parade just brilliant, to see the awe and wonder on the little ones faces was priceless.",Disneyland_Paris,132
128302620,4,2012-3,Australia,"While this park is definitely smaller than Disneyland in Anaheim, there is still that Disney magic. There is definitely a lack of thrill rides, but it bothered my husband more than me. I was happy enough just taking in all the Disney details. The Jungle Cruise is excellent, and I loved Mickey's Philharmagic and The Golden Mickeys. I really enjoyed the parade, and the fireworks. We did struggle to find food we liked, but I had a nice curry at the Royal Banquet Hall, and some nice desserts from the Main Street Bakery. When we visited it was cool and misty (but no rain), although we did have a couple of warmer clear days towards the end of our visit.",Disneyland_HongKong,120
307770024,4,2015-8,United Kingdom,"this was our 2nd visit to disneyland paris the 1st being in 2005 and i feel this park is looking a little faded around the edges,nothing appears to have changed in this park compared to the studio park,all the rides are the same,yes it's still spotlessly clean and amazing to look at,but it needs freshening up,not a lot a characters on show this time and only at set meeting points now which means NO mass riot whenever a character appears now,managed to get on BTM this time,and SM now has single rider queue only took about 5mins to get on,maybe 1 change would be to make the disney dream show a bit earlier say 21:00 instead of 23:00,as it was dark by then anyway,would recommend the plaza gardens restaurant,overall still amazing and would revisit again. ",Disneyland_Paris,135
316058279,5,2015-9,United Kingdom,This park is the big brother sister to Orlando but in name only. It is a lot smaller with only 2 parks rather than 4 & no water parks & can easily be accessed from the main road rather than entering your own little Disney bubble. Having said that it still has all of the Disney magic you would expect with a couple of added bonuses. The new Cars Land is amazing & although the main ride is totally Test Track from Epcot the way in which it is set is fantastic. Go single rider if you don't mind being split from your party & save loads of queuing time. Only minor moan was that a couple of rides were closed & not advertised very well.,Disneyland_California,126
348306911,1,2016-2,United States,"disney does not limit sales so they pack the park full daily and then you have to compete with thousands of people in line for each attraction...in between you are treated rudely and hollered at by crowd control as they herd you every which way because of the parades that are never ending and that if you don't get a seat several hours ahead of time you don't see, the herding continues for fantasmic, and again for the fireworks where you are placed in roped off pens as crowded as a tokyo subway car ..if you deviate the crowd control people are downright nasty...none of this occurs at disneyworld in florida... this place has made a quick trip downghill...amazing what corporate greed can do to a good time",Disneyland_California,128
611272766,5,2018-5,United States,"You probably already know what you think about Disneyland, even if you have never been there. It is the platonic ideal of a theme park, even more than its counterpart in Orlando.The major negative is that it is almost constantly grossly over crowded. Disney has over sold its annual passports and does not effectively limit sales at the gate. I am not really sure why they do that, because the least crowded areas of the park are food stalls and retail stores. Everything else is so crowded that it really hurts the experience.That said, the Disney Magic is real. The hooks the park has into memories that you have of childhood and are able to share with your own children are amazing. Walt Disney designed an amazing place and it has generally been extremely well maintained.",Disneyland_California,136
584401460,2,2018-6,United States,"Oh boy. So crowded. Even on a Wednesday. Lots of rides broken or closed. Wait times ridiculous even using fast pass. Save yourself the peril and pick another destination. Tip if you do go , get there in the early morning 8:00 am. However if you do want to arrive early, stay at the resort, because LA traffic will be prohibitive. You   ll spend more this way. Catch 22! Park is 60 years old and has not expanded much, but attendance has tripled. Our kids 12 and 13 has about 0 fun. Really Disney? For these prices everything should be operational and you should not have time to eat your over priced lunch while waiting in line for a ride that may or may no work by the time you get to starting gate. UUGH",Disneyland_California,135
298644774,4,2015-8,Nigeria,This was a birthday treat for our son. The park was filled with all the magic one would expect from Disney. So much to see and do and don't think we achieved up to 10% as we were only there for a day. Do whatever you can to get fast passes! We were on a queue for a ride for almost 2 hours! The ride was worth it though! Also do as much as you can to keep a firm grip on your kids as it's easy for them to get lost in the midst of the crowd within seconds. Plan to dedicate a minimum of 3 days to see Disney so you get to experience as much as possible. Will definitely come back here!,Disneyland_Paris,125
173578090,1,2013-8,Australia,This is my kids (2 & 4) first time to Disneyland   I can remember visiting both parks in the States. My first impressions were it's quite small .. but not small enough to jam pack it full of $75 pp people !! Once you understand what is overwhelming about the park   5:1 ratio of Disney Shops to buy your memorabilia because you got cheesed off waiting in 45 60 minute queues for just a 1 minute ride.Obviously the people who run the park don't hire parents   as nobody was accommodating. Why do people work in Tourism if they hate Tourists. Now   the ultimate Plus .. Being Pregnant means you get to go to the front of the lines ... nobody told us this before hand .. We found out on the last day !Queuing for unclean toilets is a joke.,Disneyland_Paris,140
237248654,4,2014-9,Australia,"Well the Hong Kong disneyland may be a lot smaller than its US big brothers, it has its advantage. You can easily do this park in one day and not feeling too exhausted. We went there during the week and not during school holidays, hardly any queue and so we just did the rides shows we really liked again and again. Our favourites (two adults and a 7 year old boy) are: evening firework show, Mickey's Philhar Magic, Mystic Manor, Grizzly mountain mine cars & buzz light year. What I also like about HK disneyland is you can get some proper food here. We had lunch (Dim Sim) and dinner at the Maxim restaurant onsite and it was quite nice, for theme parks anyway!",Disneyland_HongKong,124
243771435,5,2014-12,United States,"We went to Disneyland and Ca. Adventure for the Holiday season. They had the beautiful decorations everywhere! The Haunted Mansion is all done in Nightmare Before Christmas, love Jack Skellington ! It's a Small World has Jingle Bells in different languages and the Jungle Cruise is the Jingle Cruise! As usual the Parks were so clean and beautiful and all the Cast members were so nice and great ! I had not been to Disneyland during the Holidays for over 8 years and am so glad we went! It even rained but the Park works hard to make sure the lines are under shelter. If you've never been to the Parks at the Holidays, I say DO IT! GO and see a beautiful, magical world!",Disneyland_California,125
213299614,3,2014-6,India,"A poor cousin of the ones in LA Anaheim and Atlanta. Mere 15% of what they have to offer. Still the kids in the group with no experience of bigger and better ones were wide eyed. Somehow got the idea that there were mostly foreign tourists on package tours where this Disneyland was one attraction promised to them. But inspite of so many foreigners, the variety of food available is extremely limited and very pricy too.Our grouse is that number of activities were either dysfunctional or had been shut down for whatever reason. Waiting time further deprives many of the prime experiences to those on a day tour. On the whole recommended for those who have not been to US ones. Those who have been will be tad disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris,129
129651009,3,2012-5,India,"This was our first visit to disneyland paris and we were accompanied by our two kids, aged 11 and 14. The disneyland park is very visually attractive , clean, and Expensive!! For example, popcorn costs about 6 9 euros... thats expensive!! Except for the roller coaster rides in every segment, all rides and attractions are aimed at kids about 5 9 yrs. Elder kids may not really enjoy the park as much as their younger counterparts. Also be prepared to stand in long queues for upto an hour, for popular rides.Nonetheless, we had a good time, but i guess my expectations were a notch higher , specially for slightly older kids and adults.(over 9 years). This however does not take away from the magic of disney!! A last thing... 2 days are more than enough to cover this attraction....",Disneyland_Paris,139
114694439,5,2011-5,India,"For all those who cannot afford Disneyland USA, this is a must. You have the option of staying at Disneyland or you could go there for the day. We went there in the morning and were there till 10:00pm in the night. Many rides for kids, but lines get long as the day progresses, advisable to go on week days. It was great fun posing with all the Disney characters. There are plenty of Shows right through the day. It is recommended you do your homework a day before you get there. It is important to check the Maps Show Timings prior to your visit. Being the 5th Anniversary, we enjoyed the spectacular Firework display in the night. Great way to get there is by the MTR. Great overall experience!",Disneyland_HongKong,130
280050014,5,2015-5,India,"Disneyland Paris is a dream destination for a person of any age. Its a huge park and 2nd biggest after Orlando in US. It was originally known as Euro Disney and constructed in 1992. Disneyland Paris has 2 parts   Studios and park. If one wants to enjoy various rides, one has to go to the park which is on the right side when you enter. They have 5 distinct parts in the park   Mainstreet USA, Discovery Land, Fantasy land, Adventure land and Frontier Land. Each part has rides as per the theme. One needs atleast 2 3 days to enjoy all the rides in the park. Also, there is a train ride around the park which one must try to get a feel of the entire park.",Disneyland_Paris,127
152076521,5,2013-1,United States,"Sure, it might be over priced, there might be a ton of kids with sticky fingers running and screaming and driving their parents up the wall, but once you enter the gates of Disneyland and you walk down Main Street and you see the Castle, all complaints and worries leave your mind. There are a wide selection of rides and attractions, Space Mountain being my favourite. The food is great, but can be very expensive. The Turkey Leg is the best choice if you are low on money and it's big enough to share! The cast members are always ready to help and extremely friendly. Disneyland is very costly, but if you can go, it's worth the time and money.",Disneyland_California,120
245965031,5,2014-12,United States,"My wife and I just got back from another great trip to Disneyland! We had heard that they really transform the park into a holiday spectacular and were very happy we went to check it out! It is so energizing seeing the park all decked out with holiday decorations, Christmas trees and even a special holiday parade! They even gut a few of the rides and make it all a huge Christmas theme inside, it was really amazing to see! The Haunted Mansion and a Small World were the most decked out rides, really gets you into the Christmas Spirit. We are so glad we went during this time of the year, what a great Christmas bonus! But, beware it was very, very crowded!",Disneyland_California,124
119853025,1,2011-10,United Kingdom,This was my fourth visit to this theme park and the worst!!The place has stood still in the main with mostly the same outdated and tired attractions its overpriced overated and overcrowded!!Having paid   150.00 per day for 3 of us i expected a first class park and on going improvements after my last vist 6 years ago!! Wrong!! Same park same attarctions!! Same queues!!Queues even for the most benign rides over 80 minutes!!Food and drink so overpriced and poor standard!!Organisation no existant they just want your money and are not prepared to give value!!Maps useless!!After adding flights and hotels this is poor value for money go to Alton Towers half the price twice the experience!!At least they do give a bit of customer service!!,Disneyland_Paris,124
162605282,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,All I can say about this park is magical but their advice is 'be at the right place and the right time' this is very true. When you go there make sure you know what's going on and what time everything happens a lot of people didn't know about the 11pm parade at night which is one of the best parades there!! There are information boards everywhere across the park so theres loads of chances to find out. Also instead of waiting for the shuttles buses which are quiet as long as its not peak time (afterparades open closetime) it is a lovely walk along side a river to all Disney hotels which only takes about 10mins to get to Santa fe which is the furthest away.,Disneyland_Paris,127
274262454,5,2015-5,Canada,Was there for the 60th Anniversary Celebration on Friday. Was in the park but had to leave to check in for our flight the next day. When we left no one told us that we probably wouldn't be let back in. We waited till after the fireworks thinking that with the exodus of people we would get in no problem. Waited in line for 2 hours with no announcement or advisories from Disney staff advising how long the wait might be. For 2 hours we watched a steady stream of people leaving the park but still received no announcements as to why we weren't being let in. Gave up on the all nighter and left.All in all we still love Disney but they really dropped the ball that day. ,Disneyland_California,129
234447292,2,2014-9,United States,"I mean what can I say. It was a basic theme park. I thought Disney was supposed to be magical and for $300 it was very just ehhhh. The parking situation was terrible! The shipped us to a convention center about 15 minutes away meaning it wasn't until 45 minutes later that we finally made it to the park. We waited for 15 minutes for the Beauty and the Beast show to start and the curtain opened, the narrators began to sing and then curtain closed and they told us the show was canceled. I mean really, that's terrible disappointing for a 3 year old. The pizza was really bad and $8 a slice. I mean Little Ceasers makes better pizza. I felt like the employees there weren't that nice. It was just not the happiest place on earth.",Disneyland_California,139
607219937,4,2018-8,Portugal,"Disneyland actually had two parks, one right in front of the other. There's Disneyland and Pixerfest. For $50 more you can go to both and have unlimited entries.If you're going with a group of teenagers or young adults you'll most likely just wanna go on the rides so make sure you get there early.If you're going with older younger people or anyone who isn't allowed to ride in the most violent rides it's okay too. Both parks have great live shows that the whole family is gonna absolutely love! Just make sure you have the show times in both parks so you don't miss out on the fun ; DPs you HAVE to see Frozen. Its one of the best shows I've ever seen in my life!",Disneyland_Paris,127
534818454,4,2017-10,United Kingdom,"I came here with a friend for the door from London. We had a fun packed day! Mostly the rides are for children, but there are a few for adults too! It's great to meet the characters and we didn't wait more than 15mins unless it was for Mickey & Minnie. It was great to see the park all dressed up for Halloween and Day of the Dawn. Great fun!Food was quiet reasonable, as are drinks. Quick entry after security too. Only disappointment was the shops. I saw a few things through the day I liked that I hope would be sold in the shops by the exit and they weren't there so didn't get a chance to buy anything in the end.Great day out   really recommend for big and small kids!",Disneyland_Paris,132
415093289,5,2016-7,United States,"Since we started taking our child on travels, we try to find something for him to get distracted, to make his trip exciting. One day for him. We visited Hong Kong on July 2016, and we took him to Disney. My wife loves Disney and now we scratched off this one from the list of the many there are. It is like Disneyland in Anaheim, but with that jungle feeling, since it is in the middle of Lantau Island. Cheaper than US Disneys. The only negative side to it, it's that there are no memorable souveniers to bring back. We thought that there were going to be a lot of Chinese themed souveniers, but there weren't. We loved all the Star Wars themed attractions and Toy Story Land. Visit if you have enough time. Enjoy.",Disneyland_HongKong,135
525822458,5,2017-9,Mexico,"The park is wonderful, is everything I imagined to be and more. Can't really say a bad thing about it so I'll focus on some quick tips for the first time visitors as me:1. Buy your tickets online or in advance. There are long queues to buy them and to enter the park.2. Arrive early. See  1.3. Use the fast pass option when applicable. Use your ticket to go to a fast pass booth, it will tell you the time when you are able to go to your ride and skip waiting in line long hours.4. The Disneyland App contains a lot of info, not only it might allow you to get fast pass tickets, also will tell you in real time which rides are temporarily closed or under maintenance.Enjoy!",Disneyland_California,130
348334313,5,2016-2,United States,"We had so much fun today! We made our way at right to tomorrow land and had a short wait at Star Tours. Then we met KyloRen and Chewbacca!!! Amazing. We went to breakfast after at the Plaza Inn! Breakfast was good with waffles and omelets made to order. The character greeting was fantastic! There was a plethora of characters   Fairy Godmother, Minnie, Pluto, Chip, Captain Hook, Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger, and Max Goof! We went back to Tomorrowland and met Thor and Spider Man. Then we hit some rides and shows. Wait times vary, fast passes suggested when available, and be patient! Enjoy the fun!!! Can't wait for my next visit to the park on Thursday! I'll let you know how that goes too!",Disneyland_California,124
253015216,5,2015-2,Philippines,"I visit Disneyland in Hong Kong every year. I usually hop on the Tung Chung line and go to Citygate outlet for shopping and lunch in the morning. By 2 I arrive at the park, go to the Lion King show, watch the 3 pm parade, then go to the Golden mickey show. The small world attraction, Buzz light year is new from tomorrow land. Mickey fantasmic 4D show. End with a 7pm parade of light then with the fireworks at 8:30 pm to closing. This year I found Disneyland HK crowded on a Wednesday, this is due to the many tourist from China who crowded the attractions. Still there is no place like the happiest place on Earth especially with a perfect weather.",Disneyland_HongKong,124
470052572,5,2017-3,United Kingdom,Really went for the Star Wars in the Studio side. Park very much more aimed at children   so disappointingly few thrill rides to satisfy adults. The Big Thunder Mountain ride was good and Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast. Some big rides were closed for refurbishment. Very long queues   100 minutes plus. So be very chilled and tolerant! Managed to get to see a few characters   Minnie and Goofy after very long queues. The PhotoPass is a good idea or you get stung constantly with photo opportunities which very quickly mount up. Fun parades. The highlight was the closing show with the castle. Absolutely amazing light and laser show with fountains and loads of fireworks. I would go just to see that closing show!,Disneyland_Paris,122
164060173,3,2013-6,United States,"With younger kids, never dawned on us that Disney would have  Grad Night  events... wish we thought or heard about it. The parks were packed the couple of days we visited in early June, and not just packed making for long lines (for those w o fastpass like Matterhorn, Tower of Terror which didn't have FP running any of the days we were there), but also the teenagers were being teenagers... so pretty crazy scene there. Congratulations to them, just wish we knew better to plan smarter. Still had a good time, but couldn't help thinking that it would've been better, like all other Disney (Land or World) visits when most of the park wasn't filled with excited, crazy high school grads.",Disneyland_California,122
172628213,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"This is truly the meaning of such an over used word   awesome. The entrance to the park and the immediate environment all add up to an awe inspiring introduction. The appeal for children is sharply focused although the absence of Disney characters was surprising and disappointing. We had 7 hours of enjoyment, even the persistent queuing didn't detract from that enjoyment too much. The positives were the truly authentic sets and some brilliant rides. The negatives   other rides were pedestrian with tired ineffective animatronics   Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted House in particular. The price of food and drink was ridiculously expensive, a Coke and a small bottle of water cost 7 to 8 Euros. Overall your kids will love it and with a bit of preparation in terms of food and drink, you can avoid being ripped off.",Disneyland_Paris,140
379909271,5,2016-5,India,"Easily accessible by train. You can walk from the station and it takes hardly 7 8 minutes. If you reach early just as it opens and plan your trip on a weekday, you can see the entire park and do all the rides in one day, with time to spare. We actually had time to sit and laze around with a cup of coffee while our daughter jumped around. The food options are pretty limited and expensive, so better to carry your own soft drinks. They cost about 30 HKD in the park. Staff is courteous, as expected from a Disneyland, rides are safe and nice. But it's much smaller than the USA ones and that was a disappointment. Buy tickets on klook to save money.",Disneyland_HongKong,126
459359826,2,2017-2,Switzerland,"Disappointed with my latest visit to Disneyland that ends today. Can't say I did not have fun, but certainly not at the levels I was used to for the last 15 times I came.Too much construction work, very little attractions open, huge queues, no entertainment with less than 75 mins queue with the exception of Pinocchio and Carrousel de Lancelot.So basically 3 days without doing much except spending time in queues everywhere. The shows were nothing special, so not even these queue avoiding options were particularly interesting.A big sense of waste of money and time.Believe won't be coming back for many years to come.On a positive note, the hotel service was better than previous times despite the surrounding increased security.Well, fortunately other alternatives out there...",Disneyland_Paris,125
119414335,5,2011-5,United States,"I had been a Walt Disney World, Florida frequenter until September of 2010. We made a week long visit to the original  Happiest Place on Earth , saying it would be our  once in a lifetime trip  to California. Well, we loved it so much, we had to go back May 2011 and are planning another trip Spring 2012!Disneyland Park is quaint and so well kept. The cast members are knowledgeable and much more friendly than in Florida. Visitors also find a much different atmosphere in Disneyland. It's much more relaxed and laid back compared to Florida with everyone stressed out and rushing about. We also enjoy the better variety of food. Even the counter service choices are more  home made  and less processed. No disappointments here!",Disneyland_California,127
504926435,5,2017-7,Ireland,"From the moment you step inside the gates you cannot help but feel the magic that you would expect from Disneyland. While it's obviously not on the same scale as the Florida version, it's just enough for a short visit with many of the same rollercoasters attractions that we know and love. The staff are great, security is high but very well organised and does not delay ruin the experience at all. Food can be expensive in the parks, so bring snacks like fruit if you can as it's mostly fast food within the parks, although there are other options such as Planet Hollywood Rainforest Cafe for  real  food. It's Disneyland   it's fun, magical, exciting, all of the things you want it to be and so much more!! I cannot wait to go back :)",Disneyland_Paris,135
259995377,5,2015-3,United Kingdom,"From the moment I boarded the Disney branch of the MTR with its Mickey Mouse head shaped windows and hanging straps, I was 65 years younger. And that feeling never left me throughout the entire day. The entire park is beautifully set out with plenty of rides, loads of attentive staff, and something to catch the eye at every turn. My four year old granddaughter was enchanted   but no more so than was I.Of course there were queues for the attractions   but the queues were brilliantly handled by skilful staff. Of course it was exhausting   but you didn't realise this until you left. Of course you didn't see enough or try enough of everything ..... but there is always another visit. I certainly intended that there will be another for me!",Disneyland_HongKong,131
584715222,1,2018-6,Italy,"My review compares this park with Disney World and DisneyLand in US. The format is the same of course, more or less same attractions, Disney World is 20 times greater. But thw difference in the experience is given by the services: staff in Disney Land Paris is completely unprepared, most of them doesn't like the work (or to work!). Disorganization is the rule. Long lines for everything even on a mid week working day of May. By Long lines I mean 60mins for a horse carousel riding for less than 3mins, 75 minutes to eat in a fastfood!! I can't even imagine what happen in the week end!! It's obvious that the staff and people make the difference. Now I understand why this park it's on lose Very bad experience at all.",Disneyland_Paris,132
667232504,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"This was my second time back, being younger the first time it was obviously more amazing than the second! But the second was just as amazing!!! It   s a great day out holiday, we did fast track for a lot of the rides so we didn   t have to que long this was available for free on loads of the rides! We didn   t see many characters around the park and the parade didn   t happen either because of the rain definitely take your own food and drink! It   s expensive and actually trying to get in a restaurant to sit down is a whole other mission and you waste half your day! But an AMAZING experience can   t wait to go back!!                            ",Disneyland_Paris,123
183728656,4,2013-11,United States,"After being in HK for almost two weeks, I came out to Disney. I had not been here since early 2006 when they had been opened for a few months. The park has increased in size about 40% since I came here last. The tickets are reasonable, about $485 hkd, $585 for two days, $850hkd for a year. I bought the year since I work for an airline and could come whenever I want to. It was a nice change after being in HK for almost two weeks since I live in the usa.

Visit Mickey in toon town but be prepared to queue.Our kids love roller coasters but the scary noises and monsters on the Matterhorn left them shaking and fearful of other rides.

They may not have the most intense rides, like Six Flags, but the Disneyland Park is meant for families and the rides are meant for everyone, not just thrill seekers. There is a feeling about being in Disneyland. It is kind of like the feeling you get on Christmas morning: Pure happiness and joy. I love Disneyland and am always eager to go back.

I've never been to other Disneyland parks in the world so I am not in a position to compare, but it seemed to me there are too many visitors from PRC to this park. Others are saying food in the park was expensive but I don't think so. We went to Royal Banquet Hall and the prices were Ok. You can even save a little bit if you buy meal vouchers online in advance. One thing I experienced during my visit in September was that they made a Halloween Mickey head near the entrance, which I did not enjoy very much, just in my personal opinion.",Disneyland_HongKong,123

Going in the  off season  was definitely a good idea, because the lines for the rides were a lot shorter, and the fast passes definitely helped too. It's a shame that the Tower Of Terror is now closed, because that was our favourite ride! And with all the Marvel and Star Wars attractions  especially Jedi Training  my eldest son had a blast too!

We visited the park for 2 days day one doing all rides and jedi temple. (This was a Wednesday and tge queues were 15mins max. On Thursday we concentrated more on shows, parades, fireworks and a few favourite rides it was much busier with wait time of 30   40mins.Fireworks were AMAZING.We visited for my son's birthday and he received a birthday badge to where, staff and characters very friendly wishing him happy birthday.",Disneyland_HongKong,129

Both visits we used Ridemax to plan our days at both Disneyland and California Adventure and it is crazy how much time it save you waiting in line! We love the way Disney carries its themes all the way though the park. The kids favorite food place was the pizza place in Tomorrowland. Both my husband and I loved the pasta there as well.

Our two year old loved it....We ended up staying in Buena Park, drove to Disney around 815am and parked.. it worked out for the best...I suggest checking the weather so you are prepared.

On a weekday in September, the crowds were not bad. Short wait times for most of the rides, except for Big Thunder Mountain which had a disproportionally long line.What made this rating  Excellent  was the 20th Anniversary  Disney Dreams  night time show at park closing. I've been to Walt Disney World in Florida several times as well as amusement and theme parks around the USA and Europe. This was BY FAR the BEST show I've ever seen at a park. Absolutely stunning.

It was the nth time here and we are still not tired of it! My girl enjoyed her time at Fantasyland most but it was quite a disappointment when we realised that the Fantasy Gardens was suspended on that day.

There are great rides that even I enjoyed. opening hours were spotty during our visit, with an early close on our first day. Food obviously is pricey, so may make sense to stock up on brie and baquette before entering. Wear sturdy shoes, and get ready for some waiting, and times indicated may be on the short side. Fast pass options are available on certain rides, which offer great reductions on waiting times.

Disneyland has always been clean and efficient and have top notch rides and shows but is it really worth $125 per person when it is extremely crowded and they continue to gouge you for money once you are inside the park? I don't think so. Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are visiting the parks and make sure this won't break your budget. Once you are there, enjoy the fun and try not to get upset with the crowds. Disneyland is really the best for amusement parks.

We do have fun in Mystic Manor, Grizzly grunch and Space mountain. One day is enough for you to look around and ride everything plus to shop and the parade. But, do go there during weekdays, the queue will not take long, as maximum will get you only 10 minutes per ride. We did enjoy anyway.

Then queue to photograph with Mickey and Minnie costed us almost 1.5 hours and we realized importance of this time in the evening.

We had a baby and were asked to leave the stroller each time at the beginning of the line for attraction. And then I had to carry the baby for 45 minutes in waiting for each attraction. Bizarre and crazy experience. Never again! The attractions themself very childish and the whole experience wasn't worth the money even close. After first day my legs were finished and second day was a complete suffer.Never again we'll go to Disneyland. They even didn't have the option to buy front in line pass like Universal studios have.

As it was a Saturday, a large crowd was expected but however to our surprise the queues to the rides were not that long. Most of the crowd was found in Fantasy Land (for children).

Always remember that one day is never enough, so plan it well, get your family ready and start having fun the moment you buy the tickets. Buy the tickets online or from your hotel concierge desk better than get it onsite. The activities there were so amazing with a chance to meet your favorite characters and have a photos with them. For Mickey an the Princes there was a long que but sure you gonna wait because of the huge smile that you will see in your kids face.

Some rides stopped working while we were in the line but we later returned and they were working fine. The parade and shows were brilliant and we got to do and see everything.

The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids.

Cons: expensive whether it's a single park multiple days ticket or a multiple days hopper tickets. To top it off, staying at the Grand California hotel was not cheap too (however, I liked that we had easy access to the park), lines are always long, waited 50 minutes for peter pan ridiculous), food and drinks expensive, everything pricey!!

I know poor excuse but it works. The train goes directly to the park so there is no worrying about where to switch or if there will be language barriers. It is set up a bit different than the two US parks but it is very easy to navigate and I think you can actually get to places quicker.

Couple of quick tricks. Order pins ahead of time online at ebay (make sure its from a genuine seller) for less than $1 per pin, instead of paying $8 per pin on site. Grab fast passes early with your tickets, then walk around enjoying some smaller rides with the family and then go back for the fast pass entrance. Also, ask about single riders.

The queues for the rides were very long and the fast pass system very unclear. My kids don't complain, they got to wave to Queen Elsa and Princess Anna and that pretty much made their day.

We did the parks in about 2 1 2 days and there was nothing really there for my 7 year old who likes faster rides, Thunder mountain was about it and he was not tall enough for the Space ride.All in all very disappointing and I would next time rather spend more and go Florida as its far better and overall much better value.",Disneyland_Paris,121
156822488,5,2013-4,United States,"What can I say. It's Disneyland. It's crowded, expensive and wonderful. Two suggestions. Consider staying at the (overpriced) Grand Californian or another Disney property so you get in an hour early. That first hour is golden, not as good as it used to be as Disney has expanded the universe of people who can get in early, but the lines are still substantially shorter in that hour. We did 9 kids rids just in that one hour, so the prices at the Grand Californian were worth it. Second suggestion is to buy reserved seating for Fantasmic (through Disney Dining). You get a reserved, padded seat, coffee and a nice little dessert tray, and you can stay in the same seat for the fireworks.",Disneyland_California,123

Would recommend Disneyland Paris as a destination for a family break with young children (my daughter is 32 months old). Only downside was price of bottled water (the water fountains weren't working in the park) but you can purchase bottled water for much cheaper in the shop at the train station by the park entrance (handy to know if you have a purchase with you and don't have to carry the around in your bag all day).",Disneyland_Paris,130

We went on the day before a public holiday and the longest we queued for a ride was 15 minutes which was awesome! Refreshments are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected.

If you are staying on the resort or close by, plan to take a break mid day to refresh and beat the heat. Also, take time to speak with the cast members.

However, they then decided that my father was wheelchair bound, rather than needing support walking. This meant that he could not go on the Peter Pan or Pirates of the Caribbean ride until we returned and had it changed.

Soarin' over California  is almost worth the entrance fee by itself, although the big attraction we had come 5,500 miles to see was worth the trip   Cars Land (Radiator Springs) was wonderful.

For example, it was about 7.05pm and a staff member had directed me to the nearest toilet, however we were refused entry because we did not have the  extra magic hours  wristband. I could understand being refused entry to a ride, but to the toilet?! That is a absolutely ridiculous. A toilet is an amenity.

Our girls loved the parade and seeing the characters.

I also recommend that you purchase the 2 day pass as then you can see everything you missed out on the first time.

They let way too many people in to D'land during these times and when they are not letting anyone else in, it is standing room only. It looks like a sea of heads for as far as the eye can see and no one is moving.We usually go in July and I know there are people who say Summer is a nightmare, but at least everyone is spread out through the whole Summer, during Winter break everyone is there at basically the same two week time period. A once in a lifetime experience, but so is having your wisdom teeth pulled.As far as I'm concerned, Disneyland is the only reason to visit this part of California.",Disneyland_California,139
158526996,4,2013-4,United States,"This time I went with my grandkids ages 2 and 4. The new Fantasy Faire where you can meet, obtain autographs and photographs was wonderful. My grandaughter was charmed by Cinderella, Aurora, and Ariel. The wait was long (about an hour) on Saturday, but well worth it. You have private time with the princesses and do not feel rushed. There is also a show 4 or 5 times a day in the same area that alternates with Rapunzel and Snow White. Seating is limited and it is full by 15 30 minutes prior to showtime. A benefit of seating at the show? You get to meet the princess afterwards. Location is right by Sleeping Beauty's Castle. If you have access to early entry or extra magic hour, get there a good 30 minutes prior. Well worth it.",Disneyland_California,137
670164415,5,2019-4,United States,"I think it   s because going to Disneyland is one of my earliest memories, but I just love visiting the park every few years. You won   t find a place with friendlier more helpful staff and the entire park is so clean. Yes, it   s expensive for many and there are crowds, but you can adjust the timing of your visit for fewer crowds and you can visit on a budget if you plan ahead. It   s such a special place for so many people and kids enjoy themselves too. There are loads of online resources on how to visit on a budget such as staying at an offsite hotel and bringing your own snacks and meals. I highly recommend that everyone try it once, but be warned, it   s highly addictive. ",Disneyland_California,132
140071099,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We had a one day mission to complete both parks and succeeded. I guess we chose a good day to visit, mid week in September. The park did seem quite busy in areas but we managed to get on everything we wanted to with about two hours to kill before the Disney Dreams show at 9PM.Both parks were spotlessly clean and everything looked well cared for. The Disney Dreams show was absolutely fantastic.My top tip would be to get to the studios park first as this can be completed in a few hours then move on to the main park for the afternoon. We noticed a lot of people seem to do the parks the other way round as the studios park started to get very crowded from about 1PM.A fantastic day out!!",Disneyland_Paris,133
157307584,4,2012-7,Mexico,"Well this is Mickey Mouse with a difference. The French version of Michelle Mouse (as they call it) offers you alcoholic drinks with your standard Disney food fare, and it works. Since the addition the French fans from Paris are visiting in large numbers which greatly assists the revenue of the park. Euro disney has had many changes since it opened in 1991, but with a French director running the park, and new investors buying into Euro Disney things have improved considerably. The Wild West show is one of my favourites in French and English, 5 shows a day, so plenty of choice. Its a 45 minute show with plenty of action. Other attractions of this park are the charming villages nearby, like Crecy la Chapelle, totally delightful.",Disneyland_Paris,128
362164172,4,2016-4,United States,"Just returned 4 2 16 from our 20th time at Disneyland. This was the first time we've been underwhelmed. The main train is closed, as is Autotopia, Jungle Cruise, and the Mark Twain paddlewheel excursion. They've forever closed the Hall of Presidents and Century of Progress. Indiana Jones closed down twice when we were there (same day), after some people had waited 70 minutes in line. The worst part was that they closed Fantasyland at about 8:30, not to reopen again until 11 p.m. This also means that one cannot access the other side of the park other than walking through main street, so there was a throng of people creeping shoulder to shoulder just to get out of the Tomorrowland Fantasyland area. ",Disneyland_California,123
281451117,3,2015-6,United Kingdom,"We drove here and parked in 'B' section so quite close and there were travelators to use but then it was still quite a walk to security and then to ticket booths , good way to get people ready to sit and have a drink and a snack as soon as they arrive .The car park was not even half full the day we visited but there were still many very long queues.I didn't think the food prices were excessive considering.Leaving was a little confusing and I got lost  we seemed to be 'directed' through the 'village'   lots more shops . Some would visit again I wouldn't it left me flat and the continual roll of the same music was disheartening while waiting with a baby for mum.",Disneyland_Paris,128
135727196,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Whole idea behind trip was to take DD3 before she hits teens as our eldest two had been and she hadn't. Had to stick to school holidays ( Schools are so strict now!) and was rammed which we had predicted.Still managed to pack quite alot in.Boards displaying wait times and fast pass tickets help. The 10.30 pm parade was good but the display at the end was out of this world. Be near the castle for this if you can.Take drinks bottles and refill at fountains.Buying food from fast food stands is cheapest option if on a budget.Try and plan ahead. There is a wealth of info on this website that helped us decide what to skip and what not to miss.Wear very comfy shoes and be prepared to queue, queue, queue.",Disneyland_Paris,132
493792035,5,2017-6,United Kingdom,Definitely this is th year to go. Parades. Shows. Everything all extra special. Nothing i can fault. Plan your time properly or u will jst wander round in awe not actually achieving anything. Water fountains a godsend. Staff not interfering but helpful if u approach them. Definitely see th illumination show at close. Get a good space at least an hour before but b prepared for ignorant gits blatantly pushing in front of u. Only thing that upset me th whole week was other visitors! Smoking is a big problem. I saw cast members telling them not to and they were arguing back!. Pick your favourite character each day and queue straight away. Way before they start. Same with th train. Plan plan plan. Save save save and u will hav an amazing time ,Disneyland_Paris,134
430406594,4,2016-9,United States,"We spent 3 days visiting the two California Disney parks and had an absolutely wonderful time. Most of the lines were a manageable length (although some were long). I was thankful that for the most part Disney did a good job of providing shade for their guests while waiting in the lines. A few of the older rides broke down, but they were back up and running in time for us to be able to ride them before leaving the park. My 7 year old daughter says that she liked it all except the ride with the abominable snowman (The Matterhorn. It was pretty rickety.), lol. We also saw the Frozen show, and as another reviewer said, it was very good. I'm so glad we had the opportunity to visit!",Disneyland_California,130
313150423,4,2015-9,Australia,"Visited in September with our 6 year old. Despite it being smaller than other Disneyland, we certainly didn't run out of things to do. In fact, we could have happily spent another day, the only thing that stopped us was that the heat was quite extreme; an umbrella is recommended. We must have chosen the right time to go as there was no line up at all at popular rides such as Space Mountain and Grizzly Mountain so could go on these rides several times. Mickey's Philharmagic and It's a Small World were surprisingly good and recommended. Only significant lineup was for Winnie the Pooh ride (30 mins) which is a waste of time for children over 2! Overall, a very fun day!",Disneyland_HongKong,123
591969326,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"An amazing experience for my little family. My 5yr old was in awe of Disneyland. We didn   t stay at the resort but traveled in to save some money. Cheapest Tickets we got was from travel republic website. So much to see, but a lot of queuing. Next time I will be buying fast track tickets, as this time round we were on a budget. Take plenty of snacks, drinks etc with you. It was a very hot day and spent a lot on cold drinks and water..... for   3.50 a bottle. Extortionate prices. Highlight of the day was defo the 11pm fireworks. It was spectacular and amazing. Well worth the wait....... even though we were shattered esp my 5yr old he said it was the best by far.",Disneyland_Paris,129
637124175,5,2018-1,Malaysia,"we arrived around 15 minutes before the gates were open and stayed all day until it closed. thats how much fun we had there! of course travelling with kids there are lots of breaks you'd have to take. we enjoyed the parades, and the fireworks. for muslims travellers there is a prayers room even with an ablution area! although its not labelled as musolla and it can be use by all religions but i should give credit for the their thought of having an ablution area. the prayer room is spacious and enclosed so our children could rest for a while while we prayed. most of the rides are suitable even for my 4 year old daughter although few are not. the food at the cafeteria were also delicious.",Disneyland_HongKong,129
627019769,4,2018-10,United States,"We loved our visit before all the crowds arrived during   Fall Break    (like spring break when kids are out of school for a couple days). It   s so crowded you can   t even walk down the street together as a family. That   s not fun but before it got too crowded we were able to ride a bunch of rides repeatedly and that was really fun! It   s hard to find a time where it is not super crowded anymore though unfortunately. The prices are outrageous as well. You really have to budget, save and plan ahead. We tried to save money by bringing in our own lunches and snacks throughout the day but still ended up spending around $50 $100 daily for snacks and or one meal.",Disneyland_California,128
363012232,4,2016-4,United States,This place is nothing short of magic. We came with our kids   8 & 5   and we had one of the best 3 days of our lives. Everybody here is so friendly and approachable. You do feel transported to a magical wonderland. The only reason why I give 4 stars is because on the 60th anniversary they should have better coordination with the other park   Adventure Park  where if people went to watch the World of Colors show they ended up missing crucial part of the magical and unforgettable fireworks celebrating the diamond Celebrations. I know I am being over demanding here but one really needs to see these fireworks to know what you would have missed. As Walt Disney said   I wish This place is never complete and it continues to add more magic every year...,Disneyland_California,137
621662561,5,2018-9,Australia,"Spent 2 days at the park. Didn   t have to queue up for any rides as I am guessing it was off peak season. It was very hot though so I would probably recommend going during the cooler months, but then you might have to queue up for rides. Because of the typhoon there were a few rides that were closed. Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too. Only took our 1yr old on the    It   s A Small World    ride but my 9yr old nephew went on pretty much all the rides. Spent heaps on merchandise too! Would definitely want to go again!",Disneyland_HongKong,120
216936422,4,2014-7,France,"So this is to be expected at Disneyland. There was some things to look out for such as getting into the park that were about the roads, didnt understand that. Parking was great and the prices were very fair we were there for a day and it was worth every penny. There was a slight problem with the fastpass and from what we noticed you need to get there early get the fastpass to get the early times. we got there at 10.00 and alot of the fastpasses were for at least 6.30 or later talk about a long wait. All in all the best time to see Disneyland is again during the weekday such as mon thursday cause wow there was alot of poeple even for a sunday ",Disneyland_California,129
