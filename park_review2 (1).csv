625877829,2,2018-8,United Kingdom,"Our grandaughter loved the magic and we made sure that she enjoyed her first ever trip abroad. Yes, we knew that it was going to be exensive and we were prepared for that. What we did not expect was the lack of customer care when things were not as they should have been. A worrying aspect was that the pool at the New York Hotel was not suitable for young (or old) novice swimmers as it was the same depth throughout. We have let Eurodisney Paris know about our concerns, not to seek any financial redress, but to make them aware of the our numerous concerns. Despite sending our letter in August, we have not had a written response. Again, a customer service issue.",Disneyland_Paris,124
175536745,5,2013-5,Canada,"This is still one of the most fun and safe places to visit for all ages. They have rides for all ages. Exciting and gentle. The Disney characters can't help but make you smile and no one does a parade like Disney. Even the fire works are extra special. Something for everyone. Adventureland, New Orleans Square are our two most favourite lands. Love the Pirates, Haunted Mansion . We bought a two day pass and also went over to California Adventure where we went on Soarin' Over California. A great experience over all. The one day we didn't go to a park there was enough to do in Downtown Disney and the hotels. Everyone should experience a Disney Park at least once in their life.",Disneyland_California,125
146808341,4,2012-7,Australia,"We went there in July. We had a 2 day pass tix and stayed at one of the Disney hotel as part of the package deal. Disneyland itself was great, all the attractions were working when we were there. Disneyland HongKong is smaller than Disneyland Anaheim and Paris, but Disneyland HK has Toy Stroy land and Bear (something) land. Queing up is part of the fun at Disneyland. My only suggestion when you are queing up is stay on the line and be firm as the locals like to push in front of you. Golden Micky was my daughter favorite, make sure you get there first when it is a bit quieter. Restaurants and food courts were ok not over priced, but i found some of them were dirty. Cute to hear Mickey speaks Chinese :).",Disneyland_HongKong,136
334348622,5,2015-12,United Kingdom,"First time to Disney & it didn't disappoint! A completely magical experience for all the family!!! We had the best time and will definitely be booking to go back!!I would highly recommend trying to avoid the weekend during your trip. It just gets too busy. Waiting in line for the princess pavilion is completely worth it, if you've got a little princess yourself.The only thing that infuriated us, was when adults would stand right at the front & refuse to let the kids infront. I completely get that you e paid the same as us but a child is half your height & your an Adult!All in all, the experience was one in million. Happiest place ever & I highly recommend it!!!",Disneyland_Paris,122
228480592,2,2014-9,Estonia,"We came all the way from Europe to Disneyland , cause my 4 year old sons wante to see Mickey Mouse so so much and me myself have read several Disney books, where they explain their usiness concept, customer service etc ...  We saw Mickey , that was good , son was happy . But to be be honest, the whole park seems to be out of date , we really excpected so much more, and most of all, customer service s totally avarage , I even heard one of the employee talking bad language , good that my son doesnt undestand english :) .Day before we went to universal studios , and folks in Disney , tehy are really 10 year ahead of you , in everypossible way.....",Disneyland_California,129
165745877,1,2013-6,Canada,"Please tell me this place isn't owned and operated by the walt disney company!! After having been a disney world annual passholder for numerous years, we decided to try out a foreign disney property on our recent trip to Europe. We were so disappointed. Major rides were down for maintenance, in what I am assuming, being summer, is prime time. Other rides were regularly  temporarily paused . We would be in a long queue, only to have the ride break down, forcing us to leave . Numerous restaurants were not open, whilst there were lines into the streets for the ones that were. Not nearly enough washrooms, most always a queue, and not looked after. For an amusement park, it would be ok...but to have the Disney name attached to it....not so much. Definitely the low point of our vacation.",Disneyland_Paris,140
383488155,5,2016-5,Germany,"Saturday unbelievably busy. Could get an early entry pass from the hotel which let us in at 8am some rides open for the little ones. Some major rides closed for maintenance, but you can check on line before you travel which ones. Light show on the castle very good but too late at 11pm for kids to see it. A couple of days we went back to hotel in afternoon, out to eat in the village 5 to 6 pm then back into park and it was really quite, virtually no queues which was good for the kids. They even let us stay on one of the rides as no one was waiting  saw pinnochio loads of times!! Overall excellant for the kids and after a while you forget the rain!!!",Disneyland_Paris,131
388528722,2,2016-6,United Kingdom,"Overpriced, lack lustre & outdated! In short you pay on average    90 Euros a person to enter a Disney shopping mall. We visited last week in June & the majority of the rides were shut. Take your own food or pay over the top for poor quality food. Another great way of making more money for Disney is the clever pricing, everything ends in either.49 or.99 if you don't have the correct change they make out they have no 1 cents so this leads you to say it's only 1 cent don't worry about the change as we & numerous others did....you work the math on how much that makes them over the day. Toilets dirty or closed staff couldn't give a damn the  magic  has clearly worn off!",Disneyland_Paris,129
251902209,4,2015-1,Indonesia,"it takes about 30 minutes from hongkong island to disneyland or lantau island by MRT sub way train..the ticket is 499HKD about 800IDR, quite expensive but u will never regret it.there's so many attractions,show,game food,merchandise, ETC.i bet you one day isn't enough for you to try all the attractions cause you must wait the line about 30 minutes for each attractions,so u must arrive on Disneyland on 11Am(the open time). but i tell you that some attractions that you must try is racer at toy story land ,golden mickey at fantasy land, big grizzy bear(roller coaster) at adventure land, evening parade on 7pm and fire works on 8.30pm at sleeping beauty castle.it was a great moment,awesome feeling when you steeping the Disneyland.it feel like you become YOUNG AGAIN.",Disneyland_HongKong,128
530048726,4,2017-10,Australia,"This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them. ",Disneyland_HongKong,135
468940897,3,2017-3,United States,"Was disappointed this year on our trip to Disneyland this year. We celebrated their 60th anniversary in 2016 but this year was less than stellar. Some of the really good ride was  closed for refurbishment . This included the Matterhorn, Grizzly, Railroad, Mark Twain's paddle boat ride. On the plus side they brought back the Electric Parade. Haven't seen that in years. The Frozen show was worth the wait. It was definitely a hoot for everyone young and old. The food was great especially the corn dogs! We were disappointed with the Terrace Italian restaurant. When we approached for dinner they advised we should book ahead. I asked how would we know to book ahead we were tourists! Anyway, despite the issues it is always a good trip to Disneyland!",Disneyland_California,130
271789651,4,2014-11,United Kingdom,"Me and my fiancee have been 4 times in the past 7 years (without kids) and are planning our fifth visit (with her 13 yr old sis) this year. Each year we learn new tips and tricks to enjoy the parks. We usually visit for the bonfire show, the first week of November. This is when the park is fairly quiet and so queues are very short. We have stayed in Santa Fe hotel, (which has fab rooms at a budget price), Newport Bay ( a lot more expensive, but the view over lake is beautiful especially when the fireworks are being set off). The best hotel by far is the main Disneyland Hotel. This is well worth every penny and the only hotel we will stay at from now on. Rooms are massive, comfortable and very clean.",Disneyland_Paris,138
451360966,5,2016-8,Singapore,"The parade and the fireworks is the most awaited higlight. There are limited attractions for adult, adventure land and the star wars ride. Star wars is a new attraction and its a high speed indoor roller coaster. You must try it and repeat it five times!!! The dining areas are not so spacious so if you will visit on a weekend, be ready. Tips: 1. Bring an umbrella if you hate the sun 2. Bring extra shirt coz it's really humid and hot 3. Buy an express ticket if you're visiting on a weekend or else be ready to wait for 2hrs for queue 4. Better visit ocean park if you're traveling as a couple. You will appreciate it though if you're still fond of Mickey and mini mouse! ",Disneyland_HongKong,129
251549919,5,2015-1,New Zealand,"I have been here a few times, but wanted to introduce and share with a child so brought my Niece over from NZ. We had a blast! She loved all the rides and the parades where amazing. I have learnt now to get a mobility scooter as I have a knee that starts aching after a while so I can last all day! I brought the hopper tickets so we could go between both parks and 3 days so I could space it out with a little one. We had one whole day, came back for the fireworks one night, and then used the last day when we where going home as had a night flight. You can not come to LA and NOT go to Disneyland. Staff where amazing, and it was nice to be called Princess.",Disneyland_California,138
468482432,4,2017-3,United States,"Just returned from a Disney trip during our Spring Break. The family had been to the Orlando Parks a few times but had not been to Los Angeles. Thank god for the extra time in the park Extra Magic Hours that came with staying in a Disney hotel. We did the majority of what we wanted to do between 7:00 & 9:00 am. Star Tours was great. Pirates was closed the day we were there, so we didn't get to see the revised ride. The Park is in really good shape. Disney is still magical.But the place shows its age in the narrowness of its walkways. By 10:00am, the place was packed, and it is overrun with strollers and scooters. We will not go again during any school holiday.",Disneyland_California,129
340585777,4,2015-11,Malaysia,"We had a memorable outing at Hong Kong Disneyland on 30 11 2015. Though it was a Monday, the crowd was still quite big. Long queues for rides, shows and even at the restaurant. To top it all, the weather was so hot. But the show Lion King was a marvelous snippet of the actual musical that no one should miss. We enjoyed the day parade so much that we decided to stay for the night parade. The singing, the ever changing lightings, the cartoon characters in beautiful shiny costumes and of courses the fireworks that mark the finale of the show is a real WOW!! This is a Finland that truly bring out a child in you no matter how old you are.",Disneyland_HongKong,124
124370703,5,2012-1,Malaysia,"I don't know what it is, but as soon as you enter Disneyland, you get a magical vibe, even for adults like me and my husband. We felt that this was more of a honeymoon than our real honeymoon a month ago. Haha. However, the rides were mostly kiddy rides, as compared to Disney California Adventure Park. But there were lots to see and the Aladdin musical was so, so nice! Everything was just so beautiful. The fireworks were a bit disappointing though, as I had high expectations, and I have seen better ones. Still, I would go back if I get the chance :) Talk about reliving your childhood memories. Those characters just make us wana forget about being adults and go rushing to them. Haha. ",Disneyland_California,127
541684202,3,2017-11,United States,"An interesting twist on the traditional Anaheim location. Only 16 rides in total and geared towards children. Due to the relationship the Chinese have with their ancestors, some rides were revised or do not exist. The haunted mansion is the Mystic Manor and the only ride we went on twice. An enjoyable experience. There is no Pirates of the Caribbean as well. Tomorrowland is Star Wars and Marvel centric, which was not a bad thing. We spent a half day which was more than enough to ride everything and see the sites. We also went on a Saturday afternoon starting at around lunch and we pretty much walked onto the rides without wait. It started to get busier around 5pm. A worthy stop on the way back from Big Buddha if Disney is your thing.",Disneyland_HongKong,135
432008883,5,2015-11,United States,"I love Disneyland. Attended as child when it first opened with A E tickets. Brought my children there and we parked our camper in the parking lot area where California Adventure is. It has changed and always has improvements each time I go. Favorites are: (rides splash mountain, big thunder, Pirates, space mountain) ( shows  fireworks, fantasmic, shows that vary in the theatre by the entrance to toontown) (gardens  you could sit anywhere in Disneyland and just look in any direction and every nook and cranny has been made magical with flowers, foliage, water features and architectural creativity... And so clean always! Magical, wonderful and a perfect vacation for kids as old as me and young as my grandchildren!!! I haven't been since 2009 with grandchildren but am dying to go again. ",Disneyland_California,132
565162532,5,2018-3,United States,Disney really knows how to cater to groups of all ages. We had a blast bring kids for two days. The park is immaculate always. I never ran into one cast member that was not super friendly. They know how to train employees. My favorite place to be. The one complaint I noticed this time was even when the bathrooms were really clean they did not always have a clean smell. This was the first time I have ever noticed it. It was consistent over many trips to the restrooms over a two day period. A friend has mentioned that there was always someone using a changing table and maybe it was diapers in the trash cans. Maybe Disney should find a creative solution to that with so many families with littles being there.,Disneyland_California,134
397957542,3,2016-7,United States,"We never did Disney in the summer and I know why. It's crazy busy. I would recommend Disney World over this. The cast members aren't as friendly and the park isn't as clean as FL. Maybe it's a California thing, but we appreciate southern hospitality and we had more of that in Orlando. Even the visitors seemed friendlier. Guests will run you over with the over abundance of motorized wheelchairs and never apologize. We made the most if our day and were able to get on all the rides by utilizing Fast Pass often. Keep an eye on your time and get another as soon as you are able. We thought things would empty out late, but it was still busy at midnight. Just be aware and be patient and it can be a lot of fun. ",Disneyland_California,137
488873582,5,2017-5,United Kingdom,"First time that we had visited Disney Paris and I have to be honest, after only going to Florida I was nervous that this park would disappoint.I am happy to report that we all had a great time! The only things that we noticed is that there were no way as many characters spotted around the park. During our 4 night 5 day stay we literally didn't see one princess. We saw chip n dale, goofy n Pluto and Micky and that was it. However as we had gone for the rides and atmosphere rather than characters, it wasn't a problem, just an observation.Oh and can someone ban the guys trying to sell the    1 Eiffel Tower key rings etc please   you literally say no to one and the next one starts on you.",Disneyland_Paris,134
173931699,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"2nd visit in the past few years and still just as magical as the first time, watching the 20th anniversary celebrations   parades and castle show and fireworks   were amazing, tear inducing! So much to do and see make sure you book several days at least 3 I'd say to cover everything the rides are clearly labelled as to who they are suitable for and for the first time we went on the small world ride...wow...the animatronics were amazing we completely forgot we were listening to the same song played over and over in different languages, the weather was great which made it even better, the only downside is that shops and drinks are really expensive but then its Disney...its once in a blue moon (unless you go every year!)...treat the kids!!",Disneyland_Paris,131
614800685,4,2018-4,South Africa,"We spent a short 3 days here and it was loads of fun, but we were completely exhausted as there was so much to do in so little time. We ate dinner at the Mickey Cafe and a breakfast at The Plaza and saw the Disney characters, though there was a definite lack of places to eat at or purchase any type of food if you weren   t booked into a restaurant. So pack a snack lunchbox for children if you are visiting. Wearing comfy shoes is essential. Don   t be put off by the queues as they move fairly quickly. The lighting and fire work display are spectacular. Disney World in Florida is, however, still the number one theme park for us.",Disneyland_Paris,123
318739888,5,2015-8,United Kingdom,"I have always wanted to come here and I was not the least disappointed! Brilliant! We didn't go on any rides we just enjoyed the Cinemagique and the Parades, walked around and just savoured the view (We're not much of a rides person, anyway). It wasn't as busy as I expected it would be and we had good weather which was a plus! The fireworks at the end were amazing! We were sat at the front 30 minutes before the start of the show and it has to be one of the most magical things I have ever seen! The fireworks lasts for 20 minutes and each time it is different. I recommend you to stay and watch as it will really make you feel some type of way.",Disneyland_Paris,129
463854718,5,2017-2,United Kingdom,"We took our daughters (one an adult one aged 6) to Disneyland Paris for Feb half term. It was amazing, the park is very clean, restaurants and coffee shops are very expensive. An example is 3 coffees and three donuts    20. To meet the characters, you have to queue, in the princess pavilion where there is a different princess every day, you wait approx 90 mins, we took it in turns to queue whilst the other took our young daughter around the park. We had 3 day park passes and stayed in the park from 10am until about 18.30 after the parade finished and feel we could have stayed another 3 days, so much to see and do. We definitely recommend and will definitely be returning ",Disneyland_Paris,126
139189906,5,2012-8,India,"Just came back spending 4 days at Disney parks in LA. The thing about Disney is the more time you spend there, the more you think you can do...even after 4 days, we felt there is so much more we could have done.Really enjoyed the new Carsland rides, especially the Radiator Springs, lucky to do that twice given that typical waiting time for that one is about 2 hours. Among the favorite rides in CAP   Tower of horror, Radiator springs, Mickey's giant wheel, California screaming roller coaster, soaring over California, Grizzly river (and I'm sure I missed few). In Disneyland park, almost everything is great...The most favorite part was World of Colors and Aladdin in California adventure and Fireworks, Fantasmic in Disneyland park...simply awesome...",Disneyland_California,124
641663151,1,2018-12,Netherlands,"Of course; Disney is a must see, and with Christmas is the decoration very nice and magic. But... much to much people for much to less good atractions. We waited and waited and waited...; and saw much to less. Dramatic long waiting queues, mostly over 1 hour, in the cold rain...fronzen all over on this 24th of december... The most stupid    american thing    is the ridiculous fasspasses; when you wait, you wait extra longer because of lots of people who pay extra for the fastpass. It is a real unfair moneymaker.When you want to go; Please book your parking and entrancetickets online, we didn   t and had to pay wet 45(!) euro extra (with 4 persons): ridiculous!!We where in the park for 10 hours, and where able to visit only 8 atractions and the parade...Be warned for this real moneytrap!",Disneyland_Paris,140
340851199,5,2015-11,Singapore,"We went here on November 2015... it's our 3rd time. as usual, we enjoyed all the rides, the queue time is not very long.. average 20mins or so...we love the Grizzly gulch roller coaster... my 8 years old daughter really enjoy it and for the 2 days, we took that ride for so many times again and again...we enjoyed the Mickey and the Wondrous Book show... (although I am personally actually prefer the  Golden Mickey Show ....)...the Parade was lovely as usual... now they have the  Disney Paint the night parade .. it's nice too..this place is always a happy place and we always have a great time, will definitely make the time to come here every time we visit hong kong..!next year probably they already have the new ride (iron man)...",Disneyland_HongKong,132
291652129,4,2015-7,United Kingdom,"60 years and the place still manages to maintain the magic. If you had to describe Disney Land or for that matter the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, you would probably not rate the rides at very high level when comparing to other parks (Universal and Disney California). The atmosphere however ensures that this is a must on every visit. My kids have been to Florida and California several times and when we discuss the itinerary, they always want to start first at Disney Land (or the Florida equivalent Magic Kingdom). Do they get the most from the day? Probably not, but it is something you just have to do and it puts you in the right frame of mid for the rest of the holiday.",Disneyland_California,125
245624395,4,2014-12,United Kingdom,"This year we found there to be lots of school outings, having two young children ages 3 4 we were constantly trying to avoid being pushed about. As our little ones are not able to go on many rides we made our way to its a small world, luck was in that there were quite a few disney characters walking around. Therefore we were able to get some good photos. Only downside was we waited for the parade and none came round until 2.45pm and then again at 3.45. By this time the little ones were hungry and we had gone to eat. We enjoyed ourselves but we did find simple things like key rings pencils rulers had gone up in price.",Disneyland_Paris,122
417394116,5,2016-7,United Kingdom,Enjoyed trips six years in a row. Parks are amazing. Staff are friendly. Rides are great fun. Brilliant when you go at a quieter time. Magic hours tickets when staying in Disney Hotels are a great help. Recommend visiting Fantasyland and rides like Dumbo asap to avoid extra long waits. Also recommend taking snacks and drinks into the park. Good for little money saving but also avoids sugar fest only snacks. Half Full Board Meal Deals are great value. Fast Passes are great. Parades are amazing but get ready for a long sit to get a good seat. On the latest trip we noticed 3 huge rats running at the side of the path in the middle of the park.,Disneyland_Paris,120
394003720,3,2016-7,United States,"I grew up coming to Disneyland every summer for the past 50 years so we brought family here from abroad to spend the day and we were disappointed! Indiana jones , Hyperspace, Matterhorn and even Peter Pan experienced system glitches throughout the day so the rides were down for he at a time ( Indiana jones down several times throughout) fast pass out and after talking so much about the fireworks and watching crowds waiting for over an hr an announcement came that the fireworks would be delayed ....and then ...none this evening ! At 11pm the Peter Pan ride was open do we braved the line and the ride was great but very warm since no air conditioning. With all the profits over the years and the price we paid for 6 tickets we left bummed!",Disneyland_California,137
153412133,5,2013-2,United States,I love Disney films so was only right to drag my bf to Disney land x he enjoyed himself too and couldn't wait to get on the rides. Longer ques for the smaller rides so worth fast tracking them instead of bigger rides. Drinks are reasonable priced for a theme park. Had a corn dog for lunch which was 7 dollers. Ate in the rainforest cafe outside the park for dinner. A few rides that weren't open which was sad but they are being done up so will be even better when you go :) very hot as well but luckily loads of free water fountains. You can bring pack lunches to save money and are even able to get free photo on the buzz light year rides. Taking photos of the ride photos on your camera is also possible.,Disneyland_California,140
432914981,4,2016-10,United Kingdom,We went on a Sunday and Monday. The park was busy both days but we still got a lot done. We also went to the Halloween party which was amazing. It's divided into lands with Frontierland being my favourite. A large area of the park is sectioned off due to the expansion but don't let this put you off as there is still plenty to do.On the Sunday the longest we queued for a ride was Ghost Galaxy which was 50 minutes. On the Monday we did not queue longer than 20 minutes. We followed a plan on both days and did notice that rides we walked on had lines up to 90 minutes later in the day.As always Disney can not be faulted for it's customer service and guest interaction.,Disneyland_California,131
129984455,4,2012-5,Mexico,"My baby girl is 22, but we couldn't miss going to this Disney since we have been to the other 3. I have to say they had the greatest characters I've ever see. They pose with you, dance with you, hold your hand and walk through the park with you. The staff will take your camera and fotos for you. They were the sweetest people ever. Don't miss the lion king show, it was fantastic!  The down side is...there's no haunted mansion, there's no pirates of the Caribbean, there's no splash mountain.....and worst of all.....no funnel cake!!!!! I was so disappointed with   it's a small world  there were actual scenes with no dancing dolls, and some with only 2 or 3. I expected more out of that one. The up side is...it's cheaper, smaller, nice people, and it's still magical!!!",Disneyland_HongKong,140
423710400,4,2016-9,Vietnam,"Taking my children to Disneyland was the main purpose of my visit to Hong Kong this time. I've never been to other Disneyland parks in the world so I am not in a position to compare, but it seemed to me there are too many visitors from PRC to this park. Others are saying food in the park was expensive but I don't think so. We went to Royal Banquet Hall and the prices were Ok. You can even save a little bit if you buy meal vouchers online in advance. One thing I experienced during my visit in September was that they made a Halloween Mickey head near the entrance, which I did not enjoy very much, just in my personal opinion.",Disneyland_HongKong,123
286594233,3,2015-5,Australia,"Visited Disneyland Park with my family (2 adults, 2 kids aged 9 and 7) in late May 2015. The rides are fantastic for all ages. Especially Space Mountain. The Fast Pass system is great. But the park was so crowded that we spent most of the day queued for rides, lining up for food, waiting in line at the toilets, dodging people and making sure the kids did not get separted and lost. I assume because it was a Friday and Saturday when we visited in late Spring was the reason for such a crowd. The kids really enjoyed themselves but it was a delight for us adults to get back to the hotel each night. My recommendation is to visit on a weekday during Autum or early Spring.",Disneyland_California,129
272616760,2,missing,Belgium,"Stayed for the 2nd time at a Disney hotel for a night, which supposedly was earning me 2 more hours of  magic  on the second day. Huge disappointment! Only the park and not the Studios part was open, and even in the park only 7 rides...out of 46 were available, all practically in the  princess fairy tales   side, what do do with kids more than 8? Also during our whole stay some popular rides were completely closed like space mountain or Aladdin and yet there was no discount on the prices! At autopia , one lane was locked after 5 pm making the wait more than an hour long!!! Fortunately our kids were happy and enjoyed themselves making it worthwhile!",Disneyland_Paris,120
596463530,2,2018-7,United States,"We were excited to travel in to the park and see Aurora's castle. Coming from Disneyworld in Orlando, you have high expectations of Disney. As we turned the corner on Main Street and got our first glimpse of the castle, you left with saying,  that's it??  The trees surrounding the castle were much taller than the castle is, and instead of being in awe (as you are when you first see Cinderella's Castle, you get a better understanding of  It's a Small World.  This isn't the only big difference between Disneyland and Disneyworld, it doesn't take long walking around to see, there is no focus on the princesses at all. This park will definitely leave you being thankful that Walt had a much bigger dream in Orlando.",Disneyland_California,127
177754086,5,2013-8,India,Visit to LA is not complete without visiting the Disneyland Park. There a numerous reviews here so I cannot add much. My Top List : 1. Radiator Spring Racers2. Hollywood Tower3. Roller coaster4. Goofy Sky SchoolDon't miss the parades that happen daily at 4:30 and 6:00 pm.and the best part your visit will be signing off with spectacular display of Fireworks that happen around 9 pm. simply awesome. the changing lighting of the Castle in the Background is simply awesome. Don't miss it at any cost. Summary : I very much enjoyed this place with just one complaint. I visited in Late August and the Sun was very harsh and there is almost negligible arrangement by the park to have some sort of cover for the Sun or Rain maybe. It was really very Hot.,Disneyland_California,135

389993472,4,2016-7,United Kingdom,"Just back from Disneyland Paris and thought it was great. The downside to a trip like this though is the length of time you have to queue for everything, and I do mean everything, and for that reason I would not recommend it for very young children that can't stand on their own for an hour at a time. It's also very expensive for gifts and decent food. Too many shops all selling the same stuff and too many fast food outlets, could do with more eateries that offered healthier, affordable food. The plus side is it is truly magical with loads to do and see and we still didn't manage see everything in the 2 full days we spent in the park. I would highly recommend Ratatouille for all ages, very amusing, and Micky the magician show.",Disneyland_Paris,138
352546170,5,2016-2,United Kingdom,"Fantastic trip   and we only saw part of it. My stepdaughter loved fantasyland (she adores Disney princess tales) and all the rides were great. It's like someone has taken rides as enjoyable as the best in every other theme park and put them together in one place. We were there in the cold and sometimes wet, but I guess going when we did meant that the queues were lots shorter, so it's worth considering going in February for sure. A great trip.Ok   Disneyland Paris is not for the food. Hot dogs, chicken nuggets, burgers and doughnuts are pretty much all you get in the park itself, at least outside the pricier restaurants (many of which shut early in winter anyway).

Overall the rides are in working condition and well maintained, most of the toilets are spotless despite huge crowd around the area.The crowd control need to be improved as visitors from across the other side of the border having problem to stand and wait in the line.

SATURDAY SUNDAY. Three tips that are crucial to make an amazing experience at this park even better. 1. Go midweek. 2. Figure out what rides you want to go on and plan your day accordingly, using FastPass effectively is imperative. 3. Go early, get there as they open. We noticed a massive difference from arriving at 10.30 one morning and 9 the next. But its hard not to be happy with your time at Disneyland, it brought the kid out in me. Also, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO THE FIREWORKS DISPLAY. So good. California Adventure was awesome too. Calfornia Screamin', oh yeaaaaaaaah.",Disneyland_California,131

At this time of year half the kiosks and restaurants are closed so it was difficult to find a suitable place to eat in the park. Space Mountain, Lightning McQueen, Backlot Tour, all closed. Plus some others were temporarily shut due to technical faults. Toilets were pretty poor and not clean. Aside all of this, the park still has a magical feel and the little ones loved it. Christmas decorations added to the magic! We've been twice now and I am sure we will go again one day but our preference will be to return to Florida where they know how to do things properly!",Disneyland_Paris,131

The atmosphere was eccentric, the characters were interactive, the rides were fun and the best part was that the Disneyland Adventure Park was right across the way so you could just jump on over when you were finished! We enjoyed all of the rides here, the single rider was such a good idea! Instead of lining up for hours to get on one ride, you could choose to go on the single rider line so that you and whoever you were with were able to just get put on quickly in the empty seats! The rides only go for a couple of minutes so I didn't really even mind that we weren't seated together, we both experienced it and so much less time!",Disneyland_California,131

The best time to visit during the day is after 5.30 pm, when the sun is going down and it starts to get cooler.There are few restaurants and coffee shops inside.

The staff are nice and the park is clean. Don't forget to bring extra cash when you go shopping inside the park because the soveniers and foods are quite expensive. Don't wear heels as you get to do a lot of walking. I would suggest you arrive early or close to opening hours so you get to watch the opening parade when you can meet all the characters and then they have the 3'oclock parade which happens around 1PM and another closing parade at 10PM when you get to see the amazing fireworks.

This theme park does not need a review. It   s a great fun day out for all ages. Avoid going weekends as it can get extremely busy. we went on a Wednesday and luckily was not that busy.   longest we waited for a ride was 20mins.   The lion king show  iron man experience is a must see and the parade with all Disney characters was great fun. its happens x2. Once at 1400hrs and then last one at 1800hrs. A lot of food option and yes there is a HALAL option to.   Make your way to the Express club for traditional Indian options. Overall a good day out for all ages.,Disneyland_HongKong,138

Its not everyday you travel from Australia to go to Disneyland! The crowds were unbelievable   people, people everywhere, huge queues at every ride. I have never seen such a huge concentration of prams and wheelchairs in one place before. The parades performances were great, what we could see   people take up pole position 1 2 hrs before the event. Staff were average, looked bored and apathetic, its definitely not a magical place. My suggestion is that numbers entering the park should be capped to ensure that people have an enjoyable time . Of course this wouldn't happen because I get the feeling that it is all about money at the expense of people's enjoyment.",Disneyland_California,136

We didn   t see many characters around the park and the parade didn   t happen either because of the rain definitely take your own food and drink!

Disneyland, unlike the World if you stay close enough you can actaually walk in off the street instead of fighting lanes of potentially aggressive drivers, and paying a ridiculous amount of money to park your vehicle. The rides are at least as good as the World, the food is as good as at the World, but there is less hype and confusion. The World has the attitude of we are the best, which gets old fast.

There was a lack of characters around the park and were only a few meet and greets which resulted in long queues. Waited 2.5 hours to see a princess. There were also a lot of attractions that were closed and ones that were open were breaking down regularly for example crushers coaster. Due to this, all the other attractions had much longer waiting queues. There was also no parade at Universal Studios and only meet and greets were Mickey and buzz which I thought was extremely poor! Also Discoveryland was extremely poor due to the closures! We also went for breakfast in plaza gardens and there was no cutlery, cups or plates available to have our breakfast!!

I was surprised at how small the parks were but the convenience of being able to walk from park to park beats waiting for buses like back in Orlando. The castle always made my girlfriend faint from how tiny it was compared to the Magic kingdom one. The rides here I will say are waaaaaaaayyyy better than WDW. Indiana jones, space mountain, ect all were way more fun than I expected. Personally I loved how small and close together the two parks were. I can see why people say they like this one better.

There are a lot of good differences (healthy snacking option, less crowds, more space) and also some not so great differences (everyone smokes wherever they want, rides seem shorter).I am so happy I decided to do the day in Disneyland Paris. It was an amazing day and well worth the trip to Chessy. If you are a Disney lover then I would say you must go. Don't have any expectations and go.

So if one of your party has a disability or an injury, make the park aware of it as soon as possible, so that you can also get a pass.

The one down side was that we only went for one day, and there is no flippin way you can see even half the park in one day.

The sights and rides were great with low key ones for people like me and exciting ones for others. The parade was fantastic and I took so many photos. This was the highlight. There was usually only about a 20 minute wait for ride although it was a weekday. Entry was very reasonable and they recognised our Seniors card from Australia then all rides are free.

The nighttime parade is a musical, neon masterpiece that never gets old and finishes out a Disney day in the perfect way. We had heard horror stories of food costs and options but we couldn't have been happier. There were fresh fruit and vegetable options or you could go sugar and fatty crazy if you wanted (we chose to alternate regularly).

My granddaughter is 6 and the rides she was able to go on didn't have fast track and the queues were over an hour long. The queue for the extremely poor value for money food was just as bad. Talking to a few people, while we queued, the overall impression is that they don't care about the people going there, they just want your money. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and would give it a minus rating if that was at all possible. My tip is go to the fun fair near the Louvre.

Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters.

Half the fun is taking a peek at the menus and cart offerings as they are quirky and fun  squid popsicles, dried fish snacks, alongside more conventional offerings.

It was pretty quiet until just after lunch when the place became packed.If you don't mind splitting up, go in the singles line.

Easily ger the water inside so carry your own water bottle which you can refill.

I don't think they allow to bring food inside, but you can bring your own water. The food price is still affordable. Without a fastpass, most of the ride wait max 45 minutes.

Don't expect a US Disneyland experience because the park is too small and you just won't get one. But, do expect a bit of cultural  weirdness  if you are Western and HAVE been to US Disneyland. It's a fun, smallish and very manageable park for little kids. Enough of the well known attractions are here to keep it fun and interesting. And, they're always adding more.The food is not great so I highly recommend Maxims, the dim sum place near the castle.",Disneyland_HongKong,131

155464162,5,2012-12,United States,"While I rate Disneyland as excellent, I would have to say that the Christmas Holiday time is a nightmare (Santa's worst idea ever). They let way too many people in to D'land during these times and when they are not letting anyone else in, it is standing room only. It looks like a sea of heads for as far as the eye can see and no one is moving.We usually go in July and I know there are people who say Summer is a nightmare, but at least everyone is spread out through the whole Summer, during Winter break everyone is there at basically the same two week time period. A once in a lifetime experience, but so is having your wisdom teeth pulled.As far as I'm concerned, Disneyland is the only reason to visit this part of California.",Disneyland_California,139

If you want to do something to feel that special Disney experience, you have to pay for it and fork over some serious money for the privilege.It has become SO PURELY commercialized. Charging a fortune for everything and crammed into the churning meat grinder. The quality of the merchandise is less than mediocre and most of it is made in China.

There were plenty of opportunities to find and visit a character throughout the park. The lines were not too terrible (   5 mins) for most of them. Highly suggest the PhotoPass  option if you decide to do character dinings and spend time in both parks for a few days. You get all your photos from the park from the photographers, attractions, and character dinings. Well worth the price and that way you get plenty of family photos! Food was expensive at the park but we expected that. Overall, lots of fun for the family. Take advantage of going during the weekday if possible.",Disneyland_California,120

This forum has great tips on how to use it.Fantasmic and the fireworks are fantastic and worth waiting for. The cast members are all happy and cheerful, and the place is spotless.Favorite rides would have been star tours (54 different versions though we saw just the 3) , splash mountain , space mountain, matterhorn bobsleds and autopia.

The rides are fun and I highly recommend you get the fast passes. I love the old rides, i.e., It's a small world, Tiki room, Jungle cruise, Pirates, Haunted House, etc. It really brings me back and makes me feel like a kid again.

The finale was just amazing, hopefully TripAdvisor well allow me to add a video clip. The park was clean, only two rides were unavailable due to maintenance and ride queues were reasonable. The parades were fantastic. My only criticism would be of the food outlets, very much X & chips at every single place, which was a shame, even the kids were unimpressed with the choice (or lack of).

Same queues!!Queues even for the most benign rides over 80 minutes!!Food and drink so overpriced and poor standard!!Organisation no existant they just want your money and are not prepared to give value!!Maps useless!!After adding flights and hotels this is poor value for money go to Alton Towers half the price twice the experience!!At least they do give a bit of customer service!!,Disneyland_Paris,124

I suggest to buy your tickets ahead of time much cheaper and it saves time. The park was very clean, my son even at almost 3 could ride most of the rides and of course the parades are a must to watch. The price of food and souviniers are just like any other park you go to.

Disney is the leader in customer service. No one else can even compare. I don't know how the staff does it day in and day out. The cast member in the ticket booth was so beyond helpful when we first arrived to pick up our passes. She had so many great suggestions and tips on how to maximize our visit.

Then when they got onto the rides, they would look so bored. Guess there's really not much else to do.It is still after all a Disneyland and just being there gives you a sense of happiness.

Alot of really bad banging about on space mountain, really sore ears and we both have badly bruised shoulders.Some staff were a bit unpleasant but at the sale time I think we are spoiled having encountered the staff in Florida.

The park itself is nice and at times you can get lost in a fantasy, some awesome rides, sweet parades and plenty of facilities. However those rides have hideous wait times, the parade and light show need military planning in advance to actually see from a good spot and the food is crazily expensive. You come to expect these things from a theme park but the worst thing here is the staff who seem unable to answer a simple question without tutting and sarcastic replies.

There is really no other place that compares in making every aspect feel magical. Unlike other theme parks, every experience in this park    including standing in lines   is made interesting through meticulous attention to detail and Disney's ability to create atmospheres that truly take you to another place and time. If possible go during the week, it will be so much quieter and easier to enjoy. Also, pick up as many fast passes as possible when you first arrive (especially for the very popular attractions) so that you can optimize whatever time you have. ",Disneyland_California,122

It would be nice to see some updates. Many parts of the park appear dated. We met Snow White she had chipped nail polish. Just not what I expected. We loved the Royal Theater performances!!!

The park appeared to be very busy with people everywhere (at a guess three quarters full) and I am sure they would have been just as let down. Most of the eateries were closed as well. The western restaurant located in Frontierland was excellent. The parade started 1 2 an hour late which we observed was very hard on elderly people who had to stand.

I did give Spash Mountain a miss this time as the lines were too long.

I forgot how much walking is involved when visiting the park and I think it was more apparent this time as we visited in the middle of summer.

It was a shame the characters weren't readily available or accessible, you had to queue to meet them which we refrained from doing as some of these were at least 45 minutes long.

This obviously has a huge impact on the Queuing times of the remaining rides, and given that this park does not operate the US online fast pass system it means you will be very stretched to complete the remainder of the rides. Obviously very expensive for us Brits since the brexit exchange rate turmoil but that   s our problem but....entry pricing should reflect the availability of the rides !

As to the preferred viewing for parade , it was ridiculous . We arrive 15 minutes before the assigned time and the area was already packed four people deep.

For very young kids it is good but that's about all. We found that the studio park was so much better. If you have not been it is a good day out but do not have overly high expectations.

Parade the same as the 20th anniversary parade they have just (badly) changed the words of the song, otherwise it's the same which was disappointing. Very few characters in comparison with the earlier years. Rides stop and start constantly which is a shame, the buzz light year ride we went on 4 or 5 times and it stopped 2 or 3 times each ride, as did the haunted house ride. Exhibits in the haunted house that were once animated now do not move and it all looks very tired. Still the grandchildren enjoyed it and despite saying after my last visits I will not go back due to the deteriation no doubt I will be back, the grandkids enjoy it!",Disneyland_Paris,123

I know the one in Florida is bigger and better but if in LA head down and visit this place! Favourite part is definitely the fireworks at the end! If you're there for the rides and the rides only go DURING the fireworks and straight after! The lines are almost non existent! Most of the crowd heads straight for the door once the fire works are done so this is the best time to hop on the best rides that usually have 2 hour  wait times.The parade is great!

What a magical place for our family of four. We really enjoyed this park far greater than the Adventure Land. It seemed to have a much nicer atmosphere, a far better variety of rides and attractions and some superb shops. The parade and fireworks were fantastic and all of the staff very helpful and professional, especially the litter pickers. Some must do rides are Matterhorn Bobsleds, Indiana Jones and The Pirates of the Caribbean. Star Tours was also great but so too was almost everything. Very clean, great security and a fabulous couple of days. The magic of 'Old Watt' lives on. A definite return for us in the future.",Disneyland_California,132

Although Orlando has much more to offer because they do have 4 theme parks, water park and multiple themed hotels, the Disneyland parks in Cali is quite quaint. Its a much smaller park compared to Disney World but really worth the trip. Not much different in the rides, as both parks have similar ride, but still a bit different & unique in its own way.

This visit it was Rick, the honkey tonk piano player on Main Street. This young man is incredibly talented, and a delightful person as well. When he noticed me enjoying his playing, he called me over to sit beside him so I could see his playing more clearly. He had a crowd of children around him, watching his fingers fly over the keys, and took time out to sign autographs for him, too. All in 97'F heat! Fantastic!",Disneyland_California,134

However, the inability of park staff to enforce their own smoking ban is a severe drawback. Having to walk through groups standing smoking on pathways and in entrances to toilet facilities is not pleasant. In their defence, we did not see any of the areas that were supposed to be the specially designated areas for smokers. The solution seems to be simple, anyone smoking in an inappropriate place should be ejected from the park and their ticket cancelled. It would not take too long for the message to get through. In general though, the queues were well controlled with good communication, but nevertheless this park did not have the feel of a  Magical Kingdom  that Disney claims for it.",Disneyland_Paris,134

This visit was on my husband's 63rd birthday as we were in Paris and he's a Disney fan. As others have said, many rides were closed. I mean MANY! The whole place is sadly second rate compared to the pristine Disney grounds in America. We saw shoddy evidence of disrepair all around: cracked sidewalks, rides in need of paint, dirty canopies. The park is relatively small. Laughable, if not so sad, was the Disney parade. We waited, excited to see the  parade . It was 3 cars, with most of the main characters missing! Blink and you'd miss it all. Was supposed to be a trip highlight, and was really just a sad story to tell later. ",Disneyland_Paris,134

We stayed in Santa Fe so had the benefit of 2 extra hours in the park and made the most of this by going on the fantastic Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast and getting in the queue early for Star Tours. Parades happen throughout the afternoon finished off by the spectacular Fantalousion Parade after dark. So many different rides and shops keep this park enjoyable for children of any age!!

Then it empties out and you can go on most any ride you want without a long wait.

I spent the day here with my friend and we are Disney fans. The park has some excellent shows such as the Philharmonic and some exciting new rides that I had never been to before in the USA. One of my favorite stops was the Animator's Studio, where we learned how to draw a popular Disney character. However, I would not recommend going on a hot day. There is too much open space and at times the heat was almost unbearable, even for Hong Kong! The food selection was average; it seemed most of the restaurants served the same foods.

Finally, Classic, It's a Small World: enjoyed seeing new additions of Disney movie characters in many lands (ex Aladdin, 3 Caballeros, Woody, etc).

We had to buy new tickets again in Disneyland but the bank reimbursed the money about 2 weeks later. So just to save yourself from this headache just buy the tickets at the hotel you're staying.

We knew it wouldn   t be the same; but we were at least hoping to feel the same magic. We did not. We did not see any characters the whole time we were there. The only thing this park cares about is selling it   s merchandise. Whether it be disney or Star Wars merchandise, it was being pandered everywhere. The park is overcrowded. Ride lines are outrageous. Even with maxpass you wait over two hours. The Pixar parade was a joke. Only 20 minutes long. Food prices are through the roof.

After fireworks, they don   t let you leave out the way you came in, they shuffle you behind the scenes almost like cattle. It actually was a bit scary. If anyone tripped or anything happened I could totally see folks getting squished trampled. I cannot imagine that Walt Disney would have stood for this.

I felt the character experience were way better at Disneyland. Storm Troopers walked right up to us, the the evil queen actually spoke sarcasm to us and the lines were much faster (without magic bands) they still use paper fast passes.

The longest wait line I ever saw was 60 minutes, that's a short wait at Disney World. Most of the rides were kid (3 7) friendly.

The waiting lines were sometimes long, but if you check sign in front of each attraction you can save some time.The only minus was a situation when I was unable to pay for extremely expensive popcorn with large bill, so I've spent 20 minutes searching where I can change it.

Most of the rides are really catered towards the younger side (It's a Small World, Toon Town etc) so if you are looking at taking 'older' children, they may not enjoy it as much as you think. Queues were short at the beginning of the day and got longer and longer as the day wore on. If you visit in August September the weather will be hot and dry and we found that it was around 30 degrees most days in Anaheim.

Not sure about other European countries but an annual pass costs about the same as buying a two day pass in the UK. Couple of block out dates but look it up online. Disneyland this year on the days we went had stuff broken for hours. Thunder Mountain was off for an entire afternoon, space mission was off for the same arvo and the entire following morning. Some of the Fast Passes weren't working. OK kids, this is the trick... Check dates for block out but get a Fantasy annual pass. You can get in at 8am not 10am.

You generally had to queue for 20 30mins for those popular rides.. To beat the crowd, you should play those rides when the park is having the parade as everyone will be busy viewing it!

Best time to visit is about noon as the entry lines are almost non existent and you don't get too sun burnt. Evening time would be better to walk around and enjoy the attractions.

Since when is it acceptable for employees to walk across the park in costume carrying backpacks while looking down while texting while they are walking THROUGH THE PARK? Since when is it ok to have multiple piercings and designer sunglasses while on duty in the park?Man I have to tell you that there is a MAJOR difference between the appearance of the employees in California and the ones in Orlando.

But it was very pretty with lush landscaping as well as being very walkable. Love that the two parks are across from each other and one can go back and forth with a hopper pass. I certainly felt  in the Disney bubble  here. Downtown Disney I find is better than Disney Springs in Florida. It's prettier and more quaint. I didn't find the cast members quite as friendly as the ones at WDW. There was once when one was downright rude because my card stripe wasn't working when she was swiping it.

Certainly, California Adventure had a hint of some Disney worlds attraction and Disney sea from Tokyo but twisted to its own unique way. Nicely done!Disney land itself has made a great change. Autopia was a longest and nicest go cart I have ever tried. Nimo's submarine was uniquely introducing the world of sea along with Nimo's adventure. Story telling boat was miniature, fantasy land. Very sadly, some famous  major attractions such as It's a small world, jungle cruise, train etc were refurbished or closed.Weekends were ridiculously crowded including food court  they really should think about  less congesting  strategy. But as always, Disney's dreamy business style, which creates a fun and great time to their customers is beyond stunning.",Disneyland_California,139

We queued for over an hour on 3 separate rides when they had a mechanical fault so were turned away from the rides. When you only have one day here 3 hours out of that day is a lot when you have disappointed children with you. The place is expensive and very crowded. The highlight was the 20th Anniversary Firework and Laser Display at the end of the evening which was well worth the wait. The pushing and shoving on the other hand was not very good with people ramming you with bags and buggies   no consideration for their fellow disneyland people.,Disneyland_Paris,129

We have been to Paris & Florida Disneyland. This is a great park but a lot smaller and a lot less princesses and characters walking around than the other parks. Parade and shows good but not a patch on the other parks.All in all we had a great day here and the children throughly enjoyed it!

Going on a Mon. & Tues. in early Feb. provided no long lines. The most we waited for a ride was 20 min. There is Jedi Training for the kids in Tomorrowland which was a huge hit with our kids. (Just make sure you get there when the park opens and be prepared to wait in line to get your kids on the list. It's worth it. Request the 5:30p training because it looks cool in the dark.)

Like any theme park there will be queues just have to cope with them and decided what you would wait for. We never queued longer than 30 minutes and over 5 days went on most rides. Loved the parade. Tip is if sitting on the pavement keep you feet off the street then you don't have to stand up, that is unless you get children pushing past you and your 4 yr old to stand right in front of you. Best rides Buzz light yr and Space mountain.",Disneyland_Paris,121

We scheduled our visit on historically less busy days and times and would definitely recommend doing this if you hate long wait times. Took 3 days to manage to get tickets for the fantasmic show you really need to do early entry to get these but it is worth it. I can't do the fast rides but there are plenty more gentle rides.Play the fast pass game so that you cut down on wait times more but watch out for the times as you are limited to fast passes while waiting for one to expire. There are plenty instant fast passes especially the likes of buzz light year and later in the day. Everything is expensive you expect that in Disney. ,Disneyland_California,130

However, as we went couple of days before Chirstmas, both parks were quite crowded with large queues and a lot of waiting time. A good tip is to walk around all the games that have fast pass (passes for certain time so as to avoid queues). The experience worth the high price of the ticket, take care and have with you something to eat, especially in periods like the one before Christmas as during lunch time there are also large queues in all the food shops.",Disneyland_Paris,126

The other days were business as usual, massive crowds and hour waits, though its still better than summer.

The queues were unreal, it was far too busy you couldn't move some days, they are quite happy to take the money but feel in this occasion they let down. So many rides need updating, the fast pass system is terrible, the staff didn't deal with blatant queue jumpers.

Also do carry water bottles as the ones sold in the park are very expensive. Take five minutes to plan your visit around the park with the help of the map.

I did feel that there were too many shopping and buying experiences as opposed to rides and adventures   indeed compared with Universal Studios in Singapore, thee is absolutely no comparison at all!

The rides are truly brilliant, space mountain and splash mountain were our favourites. We got a park hopper for the day and easily covered both parks on a weekday in early May. The atmosphere is amazing and even a 3 hour downpour of heavy rain couldn't dampen our spirits!

We figured the day after MLK would be ok,...um, no. 3 long lines before we even get into the park! Main Street and the front of the castle have ugly plywood, Mansion and Splah Mntn closed...no reduction in price, but increase in crowds. Perhaps a cap on local passes?

Where they used to set the tone on delivering an overall experience, they seem to have come to a standstill where the other theme parks have caught up with them and some (like Europa Park) have even surpassed them. Don't get me wrong, going to Disneyland in Paris is still an amazing experience, especially for the kids. The  fast pass  concept works really well. The only thing that Disney needs to work on is efficiency   a lot of time is lost due to inefficient managing of waiting lines which is something where the Europa Park simply is better at.

MaxPass allows you to get Fastpasses on the go using the Disneyland Apps (a must to download so that you can know the waiting time for the different attractions).

Staying at the hotels gives you access from 8am to the park, although not all sections or all rides are open. It also means you get to the Fast Pass machines long before the park opens to the general public, so you can save yourself time later on too. Fantasyland was by far the busiest area, but probably not the best experience for our family. We enjoyed the quieter sections of Adventureland and Frontierland   especially the playgrounds which didn't require any queuing (!). The food is expensive and the queues are long.

295541714,5,2015-7,New Zealand,Disneyland is huge! ! We had a three day pass to cover both parks within the complex and definitely needed every one of those days. Use the fast pass to cut down on some of the waiting time but still expect to queue for forty to sixty minutes per ride. The great things about these queues was that the waiting area itself is interactive and has you moving through buildings rather than just standing in a line. The rides are certainly designed for family's so don't expect thrill seeker level. I think everyone has to go to Disneyland once in their life though. I would recommend this complex to everyone. Two days would reasonably cover the rides if you are not with kids. With kids you would need the full third day.,Disneyland_California,132

It   s something you should definitely do in your life, but you have to do it right:1) go early on days projected to be not crowded.2) get max pass and use the fast passes wisely for the popular rides. (They charge you extra for max pass, but it   s worth it. This is an example of them being greedy when you   re already shelling out tons to get in and 20 bucks to simply park.)3) bring some snacks so you don   t have to buy expensive food for every meal.Follow that advice and you will have a great time.

Went later on in the day waited 40 minutes got to the entrance ride broke down again. Areas of the park closed for beautification. But above all it lacked the magical experience we have become used to with Disney.Cast members seemed disinterested. Is it not time to replace Captain EO. Played to theatre which was a quarter full.

It was worth the visit to see his enjoyment and excitement.My one and only complaint, was queuing to obtain a    priority     pass for someone with a disability. There is one que that deals with able bodied people and those with moderate to severe disabilities.The ques were long and slow, not ideal for people with a disability, many cannot tolerate these conditions. When I questioned this and asked why there was not a separate line, I was told that all the people queuing had a disability. Not true. ! This system needs to be given further thought. On a more positive note, once we showed the priority pass we had fantastic treatment, staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.",Disneyland_Paris,138

There are enough heart stopping rides to get the blood pumping thou and catch you out screaming on the snap photo's they do on every ride. They in themselves are a laugh! We spent two days there and there diffenately was enough to do to full two days. We went at the end of January which is the slow season as it is their winter and there were no queues. It was great. We did have to put up with rain for 3hrs one morning before the sun came out but the rest of the time the weather was beautiful.

Compared to the Flordia, California and even Tokyo DL this one is smaller but nevertheless the fun was unlimited. The property was very well maintained, directions were as usual pretty good. One weird thing was some shows were in Chinese which we found funny (no pun intended) as we were alien to the language and more than that the lines were coming out from Mickey and company. The Halloween parade was awesome and so were the Halloween themed fireworks (we went in October). We had a great time and will not loose an opportunity of visiting again.

When we queued to enter, I was shoved and nobody seemed to care that they had pushed someone. I mean.. what's the rush if everyone got a ticket. The facilities were decent and I thought they would have been good if they attracted more civilised culture to the area. Toilets were beyond gross and wet. Food was decent, but I would rather fly to Japan for their Disneyland than fight it out with this bunch here. ",Disneyland_HongKong,132

While cues are significant (30 45 minutes on average), time passes relatively fast. Being quite crowded, we did not manage to do everything in one day.While the price of the entry ticket is very reasonable for what they offer, everything else tends to be quite expensive   food, drinks, pictures and souvenirs, but everybody buys stuff.

To explore it all in one day with some rides having impossibly long queues, the best trick is to first go to all those that have short lines and ride on as many attractions as you can, then come back for the ones that you like (but most other people also like) during midday when the sun is at its most merciless and people usually get lunch. You must have brought your own sunnies and umbrella of course. And comfy walking shoes. Don't forget that extra change of clothes and gadget with cameras in a water proof bag so you can try without worries all the rides that get people wet.

There are plenty places to sit and relax, and watch the people go by! I think we rode everything except the whirling Tea Cups, and thoroughly enjoyed the Cars ride in California Adventure Park.

Bring a water bottle and re fill it in any restaurant for free . You will at least save some money not paying $4.00 for a beverage . It is possible to do the entire park in one day .

In fact, we could have happily spent another day, the only thing that stopped us was that the heat was quite extreme; an umbrella is recommended. We must have chosen the right time to go as there was no line up at all at popular rides such as Space Mountain and Grizzly Mountain so could go on these rides several times. Mickey's Philharmagic and It's a Small World were surprisingly good and recommended. Only significant lineup was for Winnie the Pooh ride (30 mins) which is a waste of time for children over 2!

345404656,4,2015-11,Australia,As one would expect Disneyland immerses you in the magical world of Disney which we all know and love from our childhood. Although the park is clearly aimed at a younger audience it will still appeal to those who like to reminisce of their younger years. The Disney formula is consistent with other Disneyland parks around the world although the park is relatively small and can be covered in a few hours. As with all theme parks it is best to get in early as later in the day the queues for rides and attractions become increasingly longer.The thing I love about the Disney Parks is the attention to detail... every fitting and fixture is custom designed for the parks even down to the Mickey Mouse logos on the man hold covers.,Disneyland_HongKong,132

We had been to the Florida parks several times and thought this would be the same or nearly as. Unfortunately, it lacked the magic of the Florida park although some of the rides were better. In Florida you have characters at points throughout, here there were none that we saw. The food was expensive but then you are in Europe so have to expect it. They advertised 20 years of opening but did not seem to have anything special going on. I am sure we have been spoilt by going to Florida first and Europe second.

My husand and I still got to go on all the grown up rides using the single rider lane, we were on most rides in 10 minutes. One would entertain the kids, then we would swap. This was great!You could receive free photo's on the Buzz ride which was a nice touch. Plus there were plenty of reasonably priced gifts to take home for all the family.

On average you queue for an hour to meet a character but the Princess pavilion took 4 hours! And that was from getting in the queue in magic hours before the park was open to the public. Our girls loved the parade and seeing the characters. We got on a lot of the small rides reasonably quickly but the few big rides open had massive queues as a knock on effect of the other big rides being closed.I would say if you are thinking of going soon , save your money and go after the works are completed in summer 2017.",Disneyland_Paris,132

The parade of all the characters was great and the fireworks light music display was fantastic. We didn't wait long for any of the rides except for the ratatouille ride which was over an hour (worth it!) the rest were 10 15 minutes. There's a couple of thrill rides which were really fun.

Well, most attractions had longer than 1 hour waiting times and we were not able to enjoy everyone of them, since we spent time at the Walt Disney studio park. Considering the normal price, they should find a way to have shorter waiting times (the fastpass is not always convenient, if you don't know how long you have to wait at the other attractions).

Couple of quick tricks. Order pins ahead of time online at ebay (make sure its from a genuine seller) for less than $1 per pin, instead of paying $8 per pin on site. Grab fast passes early with your tickets, then walk around enjoying some smaller rides with the family and then go back for the fast pass entrance. Also, ask about single riders.

So it was awesome to navigate and even easier to ride with the MaxPass system. The meet and greet with the characters were so much fun..those castmembers do an incredible job maintaining their roles and conversing with children. The ride info castmembers however were a mixed bag. Some were great and some were less than  magical...our last day there was almost wall to wall people and strollers and motorized scooters and unruly kids..a total nightmare. The food we had was pricy but good, especially at the Carnation Cafe..what a beautiful outdoor dinner setting! We will head back when Star Wars land is open but will definitely plan for less crowded days!",Disneyland_California,136

Magical but exhausting.. Hired a buggy on the third day which was great for getting around more quickly but whilst watching the 5.30 pm parade it disapeared.. Food and drinks are pricey in the park areas ... On first day in 7 hours managed 4 rides .. Downhill from there with the queues ... Lack of toilet amenities once in the ride areas which not good when you have 3 year old .. ... Was worth it for my grandchild but for three of us for mediocre food was 200 euros a day ... A hefty price for fast food !!,Disneyland_Paris,136
397570190,4,2016-7,United States,"Fun place to visit especially early before the crowds arrive. This trip was without children so there was no pressure to go on anything or go anywhere in particular. Wonderful thing about Disneyland compared to Disneyworld is the absence of humidity   smaller crowds   and cooler temps with no rain. Went on the traditional attractions   pirates, haunted mansion, etc. and none of the high motion rides. For the entire morning we walked right into attractions   by 1 pm the park was jammed with strollers everywhere. We saw the parade at 4:30 pm after staking out a park bench in the sun (that was hot) which was fun. Many food options and so many healthier ones than years ago. The tram took us right from the parking garage. Ticket for one park for an adult was $110.",Disneyland_California,135

Majority of our day was spent at fantasyland and toy story land. All of the others playland on disney was too stimulating for my daughter.She enjoyed meeting all the disney characters and I would say that was the highlight of the whole trip. Overall we had a great time and would love to come back once mu daughter is a bit older so she can play on all of the rides.The whole park is clean, well maintained, and all of the cast members are helpful and accomodating. They also never run out of stickers, which played a great deal in calming down some of dear daughter tantrum. ",Disneyland_HongKong,134

I can't compare the incomparable and I've never seen the other Disney resorts, but the original Disney vision is still alive and well here in Anaheim, California. Research your visit ahead of time, as time will be the operative limiting factor in any visit to these Disney Resorts. My tip would be to let each person in your party visit the one top attraction on their own personal bucket list and you should walk away with a bucket full of fond memories.

There isnt much shade when lining up. Also make sure you wear good walking shoes as you will be on your feet from morning until late at night.",Disneyland_California,121

We got a fast pass for Space Mountain first but were not able to get another one for 2 hours. Be sure to get them for the rides you want to go on if possible. We never made it on Star Tours since the wait was so long. We had a great time overall. With the new fast pass system it's an additional $10.00 per person and includes the photo pass as well. Not sure if it's worth it since we only purchase 1 so we could have the photo pass. ",Disneyland_California,123

In the evening while the parade was going on, we were able to go on a lot of the rides. My kids are older and didn't care to see the parade. For dinner we ate at the Plaza Inn which is on Main Street. There were six of us and I bought three chicken meals for $15.99 a piece and bought extra biscuits. The plates are filled with food and that fed all six of us. Otherwise, we didn't spend money on any other food. We brought in our own snacks. ",Disneyland_California,139

The fast pass system is interesting (especially because its free and not only for the fortunate visitors) since it can save you a lot of time. Nevertheless, some attractions does not have this system (e.g. Crush Coaster) and I think it's not very convenient for families with small children since you've to plan and walk a lot.On one day, we could do the following attractions:Big Thunder Mountain RailroadSpace Mountain  : Mission 2The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror   Rock 'n' Roller Coaster starring AerosmithCrush's Coaster  Armageddon : les Effets Sp  ciauxCaptain EOPhantom ManorStar ToursCin  MagiqueBuzz Lightyear Laser Blast",Disneyland_Paris,137

Of the rides that were left open, 2 of the main ones that we wanted to do Splash mountain and the Indiana Jones adventure kept breaking down and ended up being closed.

The feel, look, operation and name a few things were not even close. Moreso, when you buy premium tickets to use the  Fast Pass  and the ride does not use them or you are given an excuse that they only use fast pass on the weekends make no sense. The only solution is that Disney either fix the park or remove the name. I can honestly say the Family was let down and it was a  Bust  or better yet a waste of time.",Disneyland_Paris,132

We also saw the princess show and it was fun because my daughter got to participate. I highly recommend going through Mickey's house, I thought it was amazing and I am 27 years old!

My parents had their first visit though and they loved it. A nice grassy area under a tree would have been great to sit and relax while the baby sleeps but all grassed areas were roped off.

Go during the week! If you must go on the weekend (as we had to) do the most popular rides (or at least the ones you don't want to miss) before 11am. After 11am the park starts to get packed!

We had an amazing time, it was worth it just to see the smiles on their faces. The Disney characters and Princesses are so real to small children and some adults as well.So much to see and do, something for all ages. However it is expensive but worth it. One thing that caught us out after queuing for 30 minutes for some drinks at one of the fast food restaurants, we were told that a park rule states you cannot buy drinks without buying food. So it was one fish and chips and 6 drinks please.Princess and pirates parade was very well done and both the grandchildren loved them. ",Disneyland_Paris,128

Also use fast pass tickets when available. Had loads of fun here, met loads of characters. Only disappointing thing was space mountain was closed and queue to meet princesses for an hour. Fave rides were small world, Peter Pan, thunder mountain and Indiana jones. Pirates of the carribean was also closed. Pocahontas area is great to sit and let kids run around. Make sure you've got games to play things to do for waiting in queues as can get boring. The BBQ restaurant in frontier land was great, had country band on while eating. Also, if going to see the parade then go early to get a good spot!",Disneyland_Paris,135

They have done a decent job trying to make it very much like a combination of both of the American parks on a smaller scale. The lines are pretty long and the rides are about the same as the ones in the USA. The Space Mountain Mission 2 ride was disappointing. I think the original is much better even though the new ride does take you upside down. What did stink was that the height requirements for a lot of the rides were a lot more strict than in the USA.As an American, I'd skip it. If you're a European who has never visited a Disney Park in the States, you will likely enjoy it a lot. ",Disneyland_Paris,138

Wear your running shoes and plan to stand in lines all day because it is very busy. Also, check you children's height as there are restrictions and rides, my son is 5 years old and was tall enough to do the ones he wanted. Also note, if your children are scared or the dark or of heights then you will want to do some research before you take them on a ride in case you scare them. Seems like common sense really but Indiana Jones scared my son and he didn't do many rides after that. Fortunately, there are a lot more things to do than go on rides.",Disneyland_California,124

If you get a hopper pass you can go in and out,maybe go back to your room for lunch dinner if near by,that save money. Wear good walking shoes,you really do a lot of walking sandals not advised! Don't try to do everything in one day esp. W  kids, will not go over well everyone gets cranky!! That's just a few tips that I have!:)",Disneyland_California,126

The 10.30 pm parade was good but the display at the end was out of this world. Be near the castle for this if you can.Take drinks bottles and refill at fountains.Buying food from fast food stands is cheapest option if on a budget.Try and plan ahead.

I felt like it was a small version of Disneyland back in California. I really enjoyed the fact that even though it's disney, there is a blend with the Chinese culture (like Mickey wearing a traditional Chinese suit) which made it even more interesting. We've been to Disney Tokyo and also had a similar feeling over there. The best part was booking our tickets with Klook.com. We bought our tickets on their website and didn't have to wait in line at Disney's entrance. We simply showed our e ticket on our mobile at the door and they let us right in.

Prices are exorbitant as you would expect and the queues long. We spent three days 2 nights at Disneyland Hotel with two young children and feel any less would nowhere have been enough.The Illuminations show at end of day was brilliant, a great tribute to the 25 years that the park has been running.I felt like the staff really let this place down, the energy just wasn't what you would expect from the 'happiest place on earth'.

If you have enough time, the Hotel complexes are also worth a visit and your little princess can enjoy a photo shoot in her choice of princess costume. Endless dining options are also available.

If you only have one day and you are going to visit in the future, then buy just the one day, one park pass. You don't really have time to enjoy both parks on one day.

You can walk around the castle and see a dragon. Magical.I would say that the food is crazy expensive and you have to buy complete meals....no quick snacks available beyond ice cream or popcorn.

It also took 40 minutes just to get through the main gates due to 1 person checking bags!!! Ridiculous. For a park that is celebrating 25 years you would think they would have it better managed.

The smaller attractions, like the Jungle Cruise, are just as well managed as the marquee rides, like Space Mountain. I highly recommend Disneyland for families of all ages.

I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones.

Many of the rides here are definitely more suited for the younger crowd, but then again it's Disneyland!...no one comes here for corkscrews and incline loops. If you're based in Europe or don't have a Disneyland near you, then this is for sure worth a visit. However, as I'm from California and this is a bit out of the city, I would pass on this next time I'm in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris,128
363575940,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,"Went just after Easter in the school holidays,was expecting it to be busy and it obviously was but not as bad as i was expecting. The most we had to queue was an hour and that was to meet buzz! Most of the rides were 20 25 mins but didn't feel that long. Again queuing for food wasn't too bad,we just got there abit earlier around 12 ish and it was fine. Was is lovely but expensive but you do get quite alot for your money. The light show was brilliant,even though its late,it is so worth watching. The park was spotlessly clean. The parade was brilliant too,the kids faces said it all. Although it rained heavy for two days,it did'nt spoil it for us.The stunt show is worth watching too.Would love to go again.",Disneyland_Paris,135
222735755,4,2014-8,United Kingdom,Disneyland paris was magical and we'll worth the money. You feel like a 5 yr old again. The downside is the choice of food and prices charged. Way too expensive and forget about finding much to eat if your vegetarian but too be honest we expected that. The main complaint was the crowds. When you pay so much money for your ticket you would like to enjoy the attractions. But disneyland doesn't control it's numbers and if you pay your in. I feel they should control the admissions to make it more fair and enjoyable for people that have paid so much money to get in. Some rides had 80min wait time. Imagine being in a queue for that much time with kids.,Disneyland_Paris,123
305983080,4,2015-9,United Kingdom,"Be prepared to spend a lot of money, the food is NOT cheap about    20 a head and nothing is offered cheaper unless packing own lunch. Smoking was happening whilst waiting in line for rides! My hair stunk at the end of the day. As for the rides unfortunately 2 rides broke down whilst I was in line meaning I only managed 4 rides in total of a 10 hour day. The rides I did get to go on were spectacular! The only one I didn't like was mission to space mountain. It is a brilliant ride but I don't like going upside down, I did not know it did this until too late... The park is well kept and clean but the toilets could use more care and hygiene. ",Disneyland_Paris,130
428864735,1,2016-10,United States,Not worth the cost of the ticket. You pay full price if you visit the park during the day but have to leave by 6 pm. Then pay another $89 to stay the rest of the evening. Furthermore Disney allows those who purchase the Halloween party tickets to come into the park beginning at 3 pm so the park has 2x the guests during the overlap. The halloween parade at night is quite dark and not nearly as good as the electrical parade. You will wait in long trick or treat lines to get candy that is nothing you couldn't get in a fraction of the time in your neighborhood. This is nothing but a money making scheme by Disney at the expense of its guests. ,Disneyland_California,126
221237736,5,2013-12,Australia,My husband and I visited Disneyland for the first time in December 2013. We were super lucky to experience it during Christmas and it was honestly magical :) We felt like big kids and had the best day ever. We were a little disappointed when we first arrived as it is definitely dated and in need of a face lift but once we were in and enjoying the day you forget all about it really. Our highlight was the fireworks show at the end of the night. Everyone was packed in the street and christmas music was playing and they were blowing fake snow into the street. It was like a dream and we felt like we were in a movie. I don't know what its like at any other time of year but HIGHLY recommend going at Christmas!!!,Disneyland_California,139
176773110,5,2013-9,Australia,Magical.... What's not to love about Disneyland. We came at a good time so we were told. Wasn't as busy as i expected. My 7 yr old was very sad to leave after 4 days. The fireworks are and will be the best i've ever seen. And the lazer light show was also amazing..The staff in the park were all so wonderful and helpful.We were told about the fastpass tickets but we never needed them due to it not being that busy for rides. I think 20 30 min was the most we had to wait. But that was only for a couple of rides. We did the character dining at Goofy's kitchen one morning which my 7yr old loved. Overall we had a fabulous time. We will come back to Disneyland for sure. ,Disneyland_California,134

There are some rides that are unique to HK that aren't at any other Disney. The cast members were lovely and friendly (so very Disney in the respect). I would highly recommend HK Disney to anyone but especially those with little kids   the Toy Story area is so much fun and you could spend the whole day there with them, and its unique to HK Disney. I would definitely go back to HK DIsney just not when it's summer or spring   way too humid for me, will surely go in winter next time",Disneyland_HongKong,122

Some may say that five days is way to long, but surprisingly we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was amazing. We travelled from Australia with a 10 year old, 12 year old and 17 year old, who were very thankful for then time we had spent at this place. However... I do not recommend visiting this place during peak periods(spring break) we spent numerous hours lining up for rides or to meet a character but it was all worth it In the end.Our favorite rides were space mountain and splash mountain!

They say October is the off season, but it is still crowded!! A lot of the rides we wanted to ride were down for maintenance, so it was pretty disappointing. Space Mountain was decked out for Halloween, and was by far my fave ride. It was interesting to see the differences between the same rides offered at DisneyWorld and Disneyland. We did not get the park hopper pass to include California Adventure... kind of wish we would have just gone in to that park over Disneyland... newer rides and alcoholic beverages. At least I can check Disneyland (the original) off my bucket list. I highly prefer DisneyWorld, hands down!! ",Disneyland_California,129
220936654,5,2014-8,United Kingdom,There is a huge amount to do and see and remember it is aimed at children and not adults. I understand why some reviews say the parks look tired   they do in many places but they are in Northern Europe and exposed to varied weather 365 days a year. We did not find it too busy and if you plan carefully you don't have to spend too long in queues. We managed to see most of Disneyland Park in one day with a five year old in tow. Yes the food is expensive and not great so take some with you is the best advice. Most merchandise is also expensive but what do people expect? This is the ultimate in a American commercialism. Great fun in smallish doses.,Disneyland_Paris,128

Enables you to get on more of your favourite rides and beat the massive queues.And we found that there were lots of great eateries in the parks and quite reasonable prices too, but if you are not a massive eater, go halves in a main (or entree as they are called) meal with somebody like we did!And the night time shows are sensational, a must see!We will be back.

We didn't plan on going to Disneyland Paris since we thought it would be identical but we had an extra day in Paris with no plans so we decided to hop on the subway and go. BEST DECISION EVER!PRO TIP   Buy your tickets online in advance. We would have saved about 50 euros. Even though, the tickets were not expensive. Under 200 Euros for 2 parkhopper tickets.

The ride was about 45 minutes.As we went during holiday season, the Park was crowded.When compared to Disneyland in California, this one in Paris is smaller with slightly less number of rides.One of the things that we dislike a lot was that many people smoked even when there were in line waiting for the attractions. This causes the quality of the air to be bad especially with all the people packed in the line. Even though there were many signs prohibiting smoking while in line, but yet many people do it and the Park staff do not do anything about it.Tickets were bought on site at the entrance.",Disneyland_Paris,131

The rides are childish, souvenirs are very expensive, all the restaurants close way before the park closes, almost every ride was either broken or under construction, and I only saw 2 Disney characters throughout the entire day. We really wanted to see the closing fireworks so we had to wait for 1 hour and a half in the freezing dark cold because the rides and restaurants were shut.

It's almost miserable because it's so crowded. Do they not have a crowd cap ... I wish they did!!!!! One day I went and rode 2 rides and was just done getting run over by strollers and bumped into by random people and waiting in hour long lines... So I packed up my kid and went home!!!:( Other than that  the cleanliness always makes me happy and the rides never disappoint (if you actually get on one).

Several things were closed when we were there for the first week in June (don't know if this was just our luck or the norm?). All the smaller grandkids eventually rode Space Mountain, the oldest one 3 times. Get there early! And don't overlook Fast Pass! It's definitely worth using. Note: Once you get a Fast Pass for one ride, you can't get another one on that same ticket until about 5 10 minutes before the first one comes due. Most food actually in the park is very expensive and so so in quality. Opt for minimum lunch and eat dinner outside park.

Hotel excellent and park itself as good as always. Still prefer the studios as it is just so magical and animagique is well worth watching as is the playhouse disney show and the stunt show. My top tip would be if planning on watching the wild west show don't bother to upgrade, not worth paying extra for.Just love Disney as although it isn't a relaxing holiday they do all the entertaining for me so it is well worth it and the parades and the firework spectacular are lovely.

Prior to going download the Disneyland app and have a look at which rides have the longest wait times. That way, when you get there at opening time, make a rush to those rides with the longest waits, as we found there was not as many people first thing in the morning. Also try and get fast passes where possible. We found by getting there first thing in the morning within a couple of hours we had done all the rides with the larger wait times.

Sometimes, I just go for a few hours. I try and eat before I go and then just purchase a treat, dole whip, pretzel or something like that.

We had lunch at the Starlite Diner restaurant in Tomorrowland and it was surprisingly good and reasonably priced for the chicken with rice dish with soda.

Disney World is more  magical    especially the employees ... HANDS DOWN. Disneyland (DL) workers act like it's their job   Disney World (WDW) actually makes an attempt to be magical (and succeed). Maybe it's because DL are union labor?? Probably. However, where DL is a LOT better than WDW is in updating it's rides. You go back to WDW after 5 years   the ride is exactly the same. On the other hand, DL is constantly tweaking the rides in a way where is the same , just enhanced a little and THAT is where the difference lies.

I was never prepared for such a huge crowd, and this was on a weekday and off season. I am not one who enjoys crowds or standing in lines. So Disney was just not for me. Here are a few tips.1. Reach the entrance half an hour before opening time, so that you can park your vehicle and be at the gate when it opens so that you can maximise your time at the park.2. One day is not enough to see Disney Land, so plan for atleast three days.3. You have to get the Fast Pass to avoid the huge lines..4.

She literally got fast passes and booked the hotel right in the middle of the park and i was flying everywhere :) I was super super happy, the experience is magical, non describable!!!

The rollercoasters were good enough to keep the eldest amused and the youngest loved meeting Spiderman and doing the Fantasyland rides. The fireworks and light show at closing time was fantastic and has to be seen. The parade was also good, if a bit heavy on princesses.If you haven't been, it can be pretty intense. Use the Fastpass system as much as you can, and refill your water bottle from the fountains. The food was also a bit samey in the different restaurants and would have benefitted from there being more snack options.It was expensive overall, of course, but as a once off or infrequent trip, it's worth it.",Disneyland_Paris,126

And fast pass system is worthless. You have to be at ride location to get one. Then come back to ride. You spend whole day crisscrossing park to fully utilize. Better plan   a tiered process. let people do this online in advance of visit. That way people who are trying to really see the park can plan their day and not be frustrated. Then fast pass for day of visitors for anything that's left. Then for locals who are just going because they live close and can go whenever. I would pay extra to plan in advance.

My 8 year old son had a terrific time, and that is what we were there for, but I was afraid of losing him in the people jams. We spent a lot of our time in California Adventure because of the smaller amount of people. Each day that we were there, Disneyland was sold out by at least 11:00 a.m.I now know that January 1st is a good day to go, as well as going before Christmas day. Next time we will plan this better.

Don't get me wrong, the cast members that perform in the parade and dressed in the costumes are brilliant. Unfortunately the same can't be said for those working in the shops and on the entrance gates.I would go so far as to say that France does not deserve to have Disney, so grumpy!One occasion comes to mind, a woman threw milk cup lets into my hand when I requested milk for my tea.

We however somehow did the opposite which leaves you with a very hot, very busy environment which can give you long waiting times and minimal personal space. Tourist season is packed (and I know that's obvious but I mean reeaaalllyyy packed), make sure you book the restaurant if you choose to dine for dinner  I mean any of the restaurants otherwise you will be left hungry.

We stayed at a disney hotel and really appreciated the extra magic hours to get on the rides in fantasyland with no queuing. The parade was amazing, the characters were so friendly and constantly coming up to our daughter   who was absolutely delighted with the extra attention.

We usually arrive there at around 10:00 am. We go this early because there are shorter lines. Once you get it Disney it is best if you go straight to fantasyland and all those rides before taking pictures with characters along the way. Although there are water fountains scattered around the area it would be best to bring water bottles since water is a bit pricey there. The meals are great as well. Very delicious for a theme park.

Lots of teens there but plenty of rides and attractions geared towards younger children as well..which suited us. Worth catching the parade.

It is a lot smaller with only 2 parks rather than 4 & no water parks & can easily be accessed from the main road rather than entering your own little Disney bubble. Having said that it still has all of the Disney magic you would expect with a couple of added bonuses. The new Cars Land is amazing & although the main ride is totally Test Track from Epcot the way in which it is set is fantastic. Go single rider if you don't mind being split from your party & save loads of queuing time. Only minor moan was that a couple of rides were closed & not advertised very well.,Disneyland_California,126

Honestly, this Disneyland is more suitable for kids below 15 yrs old cos the rides are not as exciting as Ocean Park. Nonetheless, we really had so much fun and learnt so much from Disneyland. Although we visited the park on the eve and on Christmas day, the queue management were really good, and we utilized the Fast Pass facility. The toilets and parks were very well maintained and constantly cleaned, which is great for us. They have strollers on rental.

Great value and worth the money, even though some rides (eg space mountain) were closed   though we expected this in low season. Both parks are doable in one day if you get there early and move fairly quickly. We did plenty of rides (most only 5 10 minutes waiting time) and still had time to see the stunt show, cinemagique, the parade & the light show. Definitely worth staying til the end for the fireworks.

Get fast passes as soon as you get there, mix in smaller rides between fast passes. More walking back and forth but less waiting in long lines. Note for California Adventure the fast pass rules are separate from Disneyland, so if you get a park hopper then you can fast pass something like this; Space Mountain, Cars, Haunted House, California Adventure etc. Wear rigid bottom comfortable walking shoes as it is a lot of walking, running shoes will not have the support. Also eat food in the downtown Disney, better quality and more options than just junk food.",Disneyland_California,128

The familiar sound of the music of Disney will greet you and you would see Mickey surfing the makeshift wave of a fountain. As you walk deeper and deeper into this wonderland of childhood fantasies and delight, I realized the child in me is still alive. It's worth it.

Very clean grounds, very organised and staff very friendly.

Wasn't able to complete the whole park in a day but the rides and shows i really enjoyed were Shows  Festival of Lion King , The Golden Mickeys , The Fireworks at the closing Rides  Mystic Manor, Grizzly Runaway Mine CarThe rest were also good, one should go to Disney to enjoy its beauty and visuals.",Disneyland_HongKong,120

However this park has a deeper connection to Walt   s ultimate vision. Disneyland has a nostalgic feeling from the moment you walk in. Walt   s memory still lives in the park. I felt his presence as I walked down main street. I closed my eyes and began to cry because it was so breathtaking. The rides are still in great working conditions. Cast members are the sweetest! I visited the park for mickeys Halloween party and a regular park day. The maxpass is in my opinion the best way to see Disney! Photos and fastpass services included.

The Park was also bigger and had more attractions so the entrance fee was more justified but still a bit on the steep side   but everything disney is!Kids will love it, anyone who loves disney will love it, but if you dont, and cant stand singing and dancing and people dressed up as a big mouse, then probably save your money or go to Ocean Park.",Disneyland_HongKong,139

There are new parades, new fireworks and an update to Wonderful World of Colour at California Adventure (sorry I can't split these two parks into one, they're a duo as far as I'm concerned).Couple of words of warning though, it's the 60th and this is an iconic much beloved place, there will be queues of people over the summer period.

This would have gotten a 5 star if  small world  and  pirates of the Caribbean  were open and  Indiana Jones  opened really late as did the  haunted house . I'm not sure if heat had anything to do with it as the the temperatures were high 90's to over 100 at some points. Being from the east coast the dry heat didn't bother us at all.

Some rides were missed because we chose to skip some rides plus we were also celebrating Mickey's Not So Scary.Also, the Haunted Mansion was dressed up with  Nightmare Before Christmas  decorations which gave a cool twist to the ride.The only bummer was  It's a Small World  was closed, but you could still see the amazing exterior.Note: If you have to choose between Disneyworld in Florida and this park, I would highly recommend this park.",Disneyland_California,125

If you go I would say go early in the day in the AM and if you can spend the night so you can go back and forth into the park. Its pretty crowded and the more you get near Xmas the worse it is.

We didn't wait at the princess pavilion (45minute) but opted for dinner with the princesses which was amazing and worth every penny! We got to see 3 princesses without having to hang around waiting.

We took full advantage of the fast passes on offer. They are free and all you have to do is swipe your park ticket in a machine outside the ride and you are then allocated with a time slot of about half an hour in which you can effectively queue jump. The food was pretty repetative, burgers and chips and ice creams and it was quite pricey but that is expected in places like this so we took our own snacks.

It is a bit annoying because sometimes there are lines of 40 min for some attractions but it is also nice that just before starting the line there is a panel which updates continuously the waiting time. What I also appreciated is that for the  dangerous  attractions like rollercoaster there is the possibility to do a different line if you enter alone, then your partner or family members don't have to wait too long since this line is usually very short.

Friday morning was fantastic. Friday evening was horrible! The park is open until midnight on Friday night, and is extremely full. It is almost impossible to walk around, and nearly dangerous walking around with small children. It was so crowded, it felt unsafe to be maneuvering throughout the park. People were aggressive with their space. The crowd is different in the evening, and feels more like a young adult party crowd, and not so much a fun family vacation. I would never go late at night again.",Disneyland_California,128

It was an amazing day, I only wish we had children to bring along with us as they all seemed to be having the time of their life. There are big lines for rides and attractions but it's to be expected and they usually move quite fast. We found after dark the lines were a lot smaller. The fireworks at the end are probably the best fireworks display I have ever seen! So impressed!!! Only warnings are the train ride home was crazy busy, could hardly move, worth it for one of the best days of my life :) would love to visit again, maybe in the future with children ",Disneyland_HongKong,129

Waits for the toilet and to eat in a restuarant added to the woe. By the time we had worked out that fast passes could be issued for some rides, it was too late, they had finished. All in all, bad value for our particular family group. We heard people say it was exceptionally busy yesterday. We had travelled from UK with our grown up children and 2 grandchildren aged 2, and thought we'd treat our family to a magical day.

We did the parks in about 2 1 2 days and there was nothing really there for my 7 year old who likes faster rides, Thunder mountain was about it and he was not tall enough for the Space ride.All in all very disappointing and I would next time rather spend more and go Florida as its far better and overall much better value.",Disneyland_Paris,121

The attractions never get old, there's something for all ages, and they are always fun. One thing I love about Disneyland is that the queue lines, even when 2 hours long, are not that tedious because of the beautiful scenery. There's always something to see, like when in line for Indiana Jones, you really get the feeling that you are in Southeast Asia about to enter a real temple! Things like that make it more exciting.

It was crowded and we all felt that the extra $105 was not worth it. The park it self was not crowded early in the morning and late at night, but the rest of the day it was jammed.

This has caused distress and embarrassment on the part of my daughter and her mother, and anger and disgust with me.Though every aspect of the trip was booked through a travel agent,and maybe it's a mistake on their part, the fact that Disney can classify a 12yo(Just!) as an adult is saddening.So much for a special start to a special day!

The longest line was probably the one to take a picture with Mickey  around 25 min, but we had to take a picture with him! We were 4 grown adults with no kids and still loved the park.

If you have been to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando everything will seem very familiar ! You enter at Town Square running into Main Street which leads to Central Plaza with the highlight Sleeping Beauty Castle beyond. Radiating from this central point are four themed zones; Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Discoveryland. There is nothing quite like the Disney experience and this is true here. My only gripe was the poor planning that closed a number of key attractions for maintenance at the same time. That said, it remains a great experience for kids and adults alike.

The light show wit fireworks at the end of the night was amazing, almost as good as the new year fireworks from 7 years ago at my last visit!

Also great places to eat, but book in advance, to avoid queuing it the best advice I can give. It does get extremely busy at times but it will do as it's a great place to visit.

251725328,5,2015-1,India,This is simply contagious. The music as soon as you enter makes you go back to your childhood. The rides really help you relive your yesteryears. The shows are truly entertaining. Do not miss the Festival of lion king and the golden mickey. Plan your trip so that you stay from 11 to 9 in the night. What will we do for so long in a children's park? Don't worry! you will not even realize and the time will soon be up. Shopping here is the best for kids. Kids will surely enjoy to the core. If you are not in a hurry postpone your trip for 2 years from now. Because they are expanding it. Right now it is the smallest of all Disneyland's.,Disneyland_HongKong,125

Sure it   s expensive, sure it can be crowded, the food and drinks are spendy but this is all known ahead of time. Today it was 115 degrees which is almost unheard of in Anaheim. So it was a bit uncomfortable and some rides were closed because it was too hot for the equipment such as the Monorail and the Matterhorn. The good news is nobody was there because it was so hot so we were able to go on lots of rides without even getting a Fast Pass!

This could have also been because many of the buildings   included its centrepiece castle and main street shops   were being renovated at the time but for whichever reason the experience felt cheap and unconvincing. Of course, the rides are still great fun and one area in particular   Mystic Point   would have been incredible had it been much bigger but if you're a completionist who has to choose one full day attraction in Hong Kong, you can easily drop this one.",Disneyland_HongKong,127

I would recomend this for kids who might be older then 2, so that they have a little bit more fun, but this is also good for younger ones.

Our favourite rides were Peter Pan and the Phantom Manor (did both repeatedly) and my oldest spend a magical hour at the Jedi Academy   the wait for that is well worth it! Although you have to have extra magic hours to get in the queue in time, my husband queued from just after 8 for the tickets to become available at 10:30, by 10 when the parks opened the queue was longer than the slots available.Highly recommend this for a family holiday!",Disneyland_Paris,126

Other than burger and chips, theres.....fish and chips, or fried chicken and chips. Nothing healthier than that. And there's nowhere to sit and have a coffee and cake, which, when your other half is queuing to get a ride with your daughter, would be a nice thing to do.

I'd never taken my 8 year old and I realized I should have taken him several years earlier as many of the cool kiddie rides I loved as a kid (Dumbo ride, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, etc) were to  babyish  for him and he had no interest in those.

Lots of drinks carts, cake carts and restaurants are plentiful so you should never go hungry or thirsty. Overall we all loved it and will save up to go back. The workers staff go out their way to make things 'magical' for you and to make the kids smile. It is a long day for both adults and kids.

239498305,4,2014-8,United States,When I was a kid it was the only place I wanted to go but larger crowds have made it difficult to enjoy all the attractions available so go early and stay late map out the rides you want to go on and go to those rides first especially the most attractive. Over the past five years they have changed ways in which you can get onto the rides in express manner I encourage spending the extra money on whatever option they have available at the time of your visit. Last piece of advice is go on a Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday the slowest days at the park and make sure they are not off days for any of the surrounding schools and make sure none of the schools have a special day planned at the park that day.,Disneyland_California,139

Still a magical place, for kids and adults alike, especially the parade and superb firework and lights show at park closing.One tip: if you have young kids ( 6) take a cheap pushchair for them to rest sleep in even if they no longer use one, it is a god send especially as the ones you can hire look more lie trolleys!",Disneyland_Paris,121

Disneyland takes you to other worlds, fun and adventure. That being said, while we went mid week and off season, the crowds were still discouraging. Believe me, it is no fun waiting 20 to 30 minutes for almost every ride  particularly when we tried to schedule our visit with supposedly lower crowds. It is hard getting through those crowds  and keeping in good spirits. (And why do people navigate with strollers like they do as madmen on the freeway?!?)

There also seemed to be a lot of construction work going on around the park and a few of the rides were shut. I have visited Disney World in Florida several times and have never encountered any of these problems there.On a positive note some of the rides were very good such as Thunder mountain, small world and Pirates of the Carribean.

Indiana Jones closed down twice when we were there (same day), after some people had waited 70 minutes in line. The worst part was that they closed Fantasyland at about 8:30, not to reopen again until 11 p.m. This also means that one cannot access the other side of the park other than walking through main street, so there was a throng of people creeping shoulder to shoulder just to get out of the Tomorrowland Fantasyland area.

It's the park I grew up with, from family vacations and I love the intersection of classic attractions, homage to Walt, and new innovations. I can't say enough good about Disneyland, and I think everyone should visit for at least a day or two in their life. The attractions and shows are amazing, and the new Paint the Night parade is my favorite Disney parade ever. I also adore their version of Fantasmic. Don't miss the Dole Whip Floats in Adventureland! Even without kids in tow, this makes a great date for grownups to let loose the kid at heart!",Disneyland_California,136

We stayed till the parade, went back to the resort and rested for a few hours before returning to see the light parade which is a must!! It was also a lot quitter at night and we had several goes on many of the rides that had long queues during the day. Having a 2 day pass allowed us to take our time and enjoy the sights at Disney and not spend all our time waiting in lines. It's a great size and almost identical to Disneyland in California.

We explained that Goldie loves Disney AND beignets at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.

I have also visited Disney in Florida and Paris and the Hong Kong one compared well, whilst not as big as the Florida park there is still plenty there to do for the day!We went on a weekday and the park was overly croweded, I think a weekend or public holiday may be busier so I would recommend a weekday if you can.Transport to the park is very convenient on the MTR from anywhere in Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong,122

It  s not the best experience ever as many people say but I had lots of fun.Star Wars attractions at first seemed silly but in the end I loved.Pirates of the Caribbean was my personal favorite, you can feel the Disney Magic there.The food is just ok, besides the amazing pretzels the restaurants serve a fast food type of meal.",Disneyland_California,122

Disneyland is old with rickety rides and and trades on its reputation. If you have iPad friendly kids, it's not very interesting. Either go to Universal Studios, Six Flags or somewhere else. If you are going for nostalgia that's fine fine but you'll get over it in about 30 minutes and the kid's won't be thrilled. We went on a Friday and it was packed. Not fun.

If you want rides you have to also buy a ticket to California Adventure park. We also attended Mickey's Halloween Party. This was advertised as a ticketed event that sold out quickly. It is offered over several days so we thought the tickets would make the event less crowded. Boy were we wrong! It was so crowded we could barely move. People crowded around the castle for the fireworks show and started shoving so we could barely see what was going on even though we went and waited an half hour early to see the show.,Disneyland_California,122

You take picture with disney characters only at a specific time on the day, that too after queuing for almost an hour. These characters don't roam around the park freely. Much hyped Disney Parade was cancelled due to rain, so much of a disappointment there.Overall, I wont recommend this place, specially at price tag of 500 HKD, not at all worth it.

We won't ever be going to a disneyland park ever again even for free as it is a waste of a day.

It was so frustrating! We were pleased with the offer because it was such good value but actually getting our hands on the treat almost made it not worth the bother. We were determined not to let it beat us. We tried queueing in different queues and using hand signals when we thought our queue was going to get to the counter quicker!

Some of the must do rides if you are a adrenaline junkie are Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones and Starwars: Hyperspace Mountain. Also, the Parade is a must see and it starts at 5:30 pm. Fireworks are banned across Europe hence the Disney Illuminations don   t take place here.Use the express pass intelligently and you will save precious time.

Radiator Springs was a disappointment and doesn't come close to EPCOT's Test Track. Tower of Terror is always great and because we went early at opening and the parks were slightly quiet, we were offered the chance to stay on the ride and go again without getting off!

There is more, but I don't want to ruin it for you. My wife situated herself next to the tour guide and asked questions when we were just walking. We picked his brain.

This park needs improving in the FLOW  make lands connect already!!! Too many dead ends! Scary crowded  not enough places to eat; waited 40 min for a Dole whip (which was overpriced and all air anyway).If you go pack a lunch and bring water  you will save a lot of time!The Fastpasses are great  the paper pass system works well though keeps you running.

We stayed in Disneyland Hotel so had access from 8am but not that many rides are actually open early. Careful planning is needed.

The problem is the complete lack of organizations, the workers almost always with no smiles and long faces and the loss of quality time that leaves.The qeues are bigger because they are not well organized.

It seems that Disneyland has become a cash cow for the Disney company, they seem to do very little maintenance or upkeep. The Star Tours was fantastic since it has been updated, now every time you ride you can get a different adventure.

My advice is to go during the off season, stay at one of the local hotels across the street, buy food & drinks outside of the resort.

If you want a VIP experience I recommend to take advantage of a VIP tour which includes a tour host for six hours. This experience is pricey but well worth it as you get to avoid the lines for most of the rides, you do not have to think or spend time figuring out where or how to get to the different attractions, and you have someone knowledge about the park's history and facts.",Disneyland_California,138

Food is good but relatively expensive for the fast food.Tip is to book a main restaurant for the evening as they sell out the international Buffett however is very good.Great for all ages and you can do the Walt Disney studios in the same day so buy tickets that gives you access to both.If there on a Saturday stay until the end at 10pm they have Disney dreams which is unbelievable.",Disneyland_Paris,130

That being said the park was packed and we went on many rides and never waited for more than 20 mins. Listen to advice and get fast passes early from rides you really want to visit. Found most rides the wait was about half as they showed.

If you want to dine in the restaurant in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, (Blue Bayou) make a reservation at least two weeks out.

The atmosphere was great although wanted an early dinner around 5pm and every food place we chose to stop at were closing for some reason and wouldn't tell us why just told us to leave eventually found somewhere though. Also whilst there are dedicated smoking areas it appears no one seemed to care and there was a lot of smoking which I think needs to be addressed because it was rather a turn off especially around small children.,Disneyland_Paris,123
166098155,4,2013-1,Philippines,"My visit in Disneyland Hongkong was very nice. Friendly people everywhere, with a big smile in there face.Now   my review:Short   its a very nice place, spezially for families,, but also for all ages. The area is very clean. Its a little bit of magic wonderland.When i was there, no waiting time at the attractions, so you really can go inside and have fun.Maybe its cause of the price, but its not the only one disney resort i know, and you have this everywhere.There is only one   its small. But its growing. Some new attractions are in work. So all in all   in the next weeks you can find a very nice area with a lot of funny attractions.Must see for all disney fans ",Disneyland_HongKong,123

Was worried after reading the negative reviews about it being small etc.... but in the end still decided to go... And...Sure glad we did!! We had a blast, unleashing the kiddos in us grown ups. Plenty of laughter and fun throughout the day. Maybe it helps that we are huge fans of classic Disney cartoons. The songs and cartoon characters always brings back fond childhood memories. The only downside was the queue for rides and the hot weather...(it was incredibly sunny and humid when we were there   but definitely thankful it didn't rain!).

Trick or treating (but the lines were so long we skipped this)...some special shows and villains out in the parks. Special fireworks. I always feel badly for those who purchased tickets for the day to learn that the park closes at 7 for the party, so check the dates ahead. One thing we learned   it is Anaheim and we didn't factor in how warm it might be when planning our costumes and one of the party was pretty miserable all evening due to the heat   so next time we will plan how to layer our costumes. Was a fun event, I would do it again.",Disneyland_California,127

The down side is you are pushing the wheelchair as you go your way around the park, the up side is that you are given priority in lines.They keep on adding areas to this park, the last time we are here, the toy storyland just opened. Now they added 2 additional areas. In 2016, the iron man rides will be opened, another reason to visit again.Parade are scheduled at 3pm, 7 pm and fireworks at 9pm. 30 minutes before these time, better plant yourselves in strategic areas to have the best view.

First try the Disney studio then second half go to Disney park. Don't forget to see the Disney parade at 5.00 pm stand any section and stay there it's a 15 min parade and totally worth it.Some of the rides are really thrilling and even scary if you have strong never good for you.Advise : Bring packed food so that in the long waiting cue you can finish your lunch and not waste time.

I was excited to be going to Paris Disneyland to enjoy the magic again. It was an easy train trip there, with the station being right on the doorstep. It is definitely worth seeing, but my son and I were so disappointed at how many attractions were closed. It was worth going to just for the night light show   absolutely amazing. Just be prepared for a mass exodus when the light show is over as this starts at 10.30pm at park closure. It's a shame people are allowed to smoke in Disneyland.

Some of the attractions had long lines and sometimes we couldn't even get to stay away from the sun, but at the end, we enjoyed it a lot.

This was our first visit (w  kids) and we've been to WDW many many times. The kids loved the attractions, shows and nighttime fireworks. The one disappointment was the monorail, we hoped to ride it from Downtown Disney into the park but it was always a 45  minute wait (people just sit and ride around vs, get on off at the station, and it has very limited capacity). The perfect spot for parade and fireworks viewing was in front of Small World. We would definitely return here with the kids if we're ever in LA again.",Disneyland_California,137

The characters such as micky, Donald, guffi, selpping beauty, cindrela etc are looks so real. One can take pics with all the characters absolutely free.

There's no friendly smiles anymore and you may even get an elbow or two just shuffling thru the crowds. Family values don't exist anymore either, they now cater to specific  genders  which can be confusing to a small child in passing seeing 2 males together making out much less or 2 females doing the same.I wished we could go back to when times were simple and E tickets were still there.",Disneyland_California,123

Count on long lines. Some days, the most popular attractions had their complete allotment of FastPasses issued by noon. A single day in the park is not enough during this time of year. You have to plan at least three days to experience everything. Finally, the food in Disneyland is overpriced and mediocre at best. You best bet is to eat a good breakfast at your hotel or somewhere outside the park before you enter. Bring snacks, then eat dinner in California Adventure where the selection is a little better. The holiday fireworks with snow falling on main street is well worth the crowds.",Disneyland_California,128

This time of the year, it gets darker faster, so the mornings are the best time for water rides (so you have time to dry off) and little kids rides. We also have some gluten intollerance in our group and at every food stall we were accommodated graciously. The castle this time of year is pure magic.

It is totally worth going here. Out of all the rides, The Indiana Jones, It's a small world, Jungle Cruise and Haunted Mansion are the best and a must to go.

The first day it rained all the shows were cancelled (fireworks, world of color, etc) so everyone left and all the big rides had 5 to 15 minute wait times, it was great. Pack in your snacks, prices for food are ridiculous, we packed fruit, water, sodas, chips, granola bars etc. When there was a long wait time that's when we would eat our snadwiches in line.

At times, we took advantage of the Fast Pass tickets and I highly recommend doing that as much as possible. Some of the restaurants in the CA park were very good.

There is a fast track service but this is limited to one ride every couple of hours.Save you money and go to Florida where there is more space and more to do for a fraction of the cost.The park itself is not well maintained and is a bit tired and could do with a make over.

The parades were great, and the characters also.The food is ridiculously priced,    11 for a milkshake,    15 for a hot dog! I'd advise to take a picnic. There are gift shops at every turn and again everything is ridiculously overpriced. We were lucky enough to have a green card (queue jump) as our son is disabled, otherwise I think it would have been pretty miserable as the queues averaged 2hrs.We had a lovely time, and 4 days was enough for us. I don't think we would return, we'd try USA instead.",Disneyland_Paris,126
580857180,5,2018-5,Switzerland,"We stayed for 3 days 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the magic of Disney. The park is well maintained, clean and amazing. Of course there were lots of people, but this was expected. The waiting time at different rides was ok (10   30 min). It's probably much higher during summer. Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best, but we nevertheless enjoyed our stay. The parade was great, the staff in general was very friendly. The variety of food offered at the restaurants could be better, but we didn't expect anything else (usual food at parks). I have both visited Disneyworld and Disneyland in the USA and it comes very close. All in all a very nice experience I wouldn't want to miss.",Disneyland_Paris,121

Lots of activities for younger children that our teenagers aged 15, 17 and 19 thought were lame so skipped them. Loved the log flume rides of which there are quite a few. Food was plentiful and reasonably priced. So many different options. Car parking is very well away from entrance so popping out to your car for food or sunscreen is a major walk and tram train ride. Pretty much all the rides were bag and camera friendly so you didn't have to use lockers or leave stuff with other people. We stayed until midnight and really did the place over. Teenagers loved the self drive cars the best.",Disneyland_California,129
534787715,3,2017-5,Australia,"We love Disney parks but this one lacks so much appeal compared to USA parks. There is no atmosphere in the park, in parts it was like a deserted ghost town. It is smaller compared to the others which is not a problem but its just lacking in so many ways. The staff are not as friendly either.Some good rides there like your usual space mountain, buzz lightyear etc. Food and drinks are really expensive so be prepared. As a family we never had to really que for anything which was great. Sadly we did not see the parade as a huge storm came over the park. This did not detract from our day as we have seen parades before. Can't quite put my finger on it but we all agreed the park was missing the Disney sparkle.",Disneyland_HongKong,138

Visit with whoever you want, it is a bit pricey but order online and make it cheaper but it will always be worth the price! Rides were amazing and queue times even in the summer were very fast and didn   t have to wait long at all. There   s something for everyone in the park with so many refreshments and merchandise shops. The scenery is beautiful and the statues are just eye watering.

It   s a small world boat ride for young children is a must see  BRILLIANT. The wait to pass thru security is teadious but necessary and the lines horrendous   extremely busy midweek so hate to see it on w ends. Had 5 day pass which we needed to do it properly. Gets very expensive and overcrowded but glad I can say I   ve been. Lovely at night and felt very safe walking back to Shereton hotel at night.

A definite fast pass is the Indiana Jones ride in Adventure land and the Thunder railway in Frontierland. We did the bobsleds in the venting and the lights were fantastic.Lots of stuff to buy. Food is better than I remember 5 years ago as more choices than just deep fried available.Good walking shoes and determination to complete most things are a must! We have a 2 day park hopper and will be back again tomorrow. It   s great going between the two parks with California adventure and also downtown Disney. Yep still great even after all these years.,Disneyland_California,128
665910063,4,2019-3,United States,My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.,Disneyland_HongKong,125

471644937,5,2017-3,United States,After many visits to Disney World we made our first trek to Southern California to take in Disneyland. The park is similar to Magic Kingdom in layout and design. The park is clean and safe and has plenty of Disney Magic. The castle is not the scale of Cinderella's castle at DW but it is an Icon itself being the first. If you're a Disney fan this is a must because this is the only park Walt himself had his hands on. There are numerous rides and shows but my favorite thing was near the entrance at the Lincoln building you can see the bench and a horse from the carousel that Walt sat on when he would take his kids and dreamed up the Disney resorts. Incredible!,Disneyland_California,128
191002420,4,2013-2,Taiwan,"The happiest place on earth. Disneyland Hong Kong does not disappoint.Re creating many of the exact features of the original one in California but on a much smaller scale, the theme park contains the usual four Disney themed lands along with classic rides and attractions, as well as high caliber performances, shows and parades. Don't miss the space mountain ride and feel like a real space rider. And before the day ends witness the night sky come alive with this dazzling pyrotechnic pageant   Disney in the stars!The park is small enough that all attractions should be accessible in one day. The tickets may be slightly expensive, but they're worth it. All in all, Disneyland is a wonderful place, and I recommend giving it a chance!",Disneyland_HongKong,125
189415806,1,2014-1,United States,We have been Disney supporters for many years. But each year they go up an incredible amount of money for their annual passes and Dailey ones too. Then you get there and every line is at least a 30 min wait and most are 45 or more. If you ride a really popular ride 11 2 to 2 hours. For the amount they charge to get in its really not worth it to only be able to ride 8 10 rides in a 12 hour period. I would suggest to lower the number of people let into the park to make it more bearable but Disney is far too greedy and might miss out on a few hundred thousand coke sales,Disneyland_California,121

How wrong I was!These parks are every bit as Disney as the ones in America, and in fact being set in France I think gives them a very nice European feel. The staff are warm, friendly & helpful & the parks are clean and well kept. The gift shops are expensive but there is a good choice of merchandise on offer. There is a large variety of good quality restaurants in the hotels & in the parks.I have actually visited Disneyland Paris twice this year (April & August), having booked to go again as soon as I got home!",Disneyland_Paris,126

There is not one little detail missed to enhance your experience...I had stew in a bread bowl and the pieces of bread that were removed were placed at the top so it looked like Mickey Mouse! Every character does more than their best and the princesses are superlative! We treated my 4 year old granddaughter to the Bippity Boppity Boutique and it was worth every penny! World of Color, Fantasmic!, and the parade were well worth the wait. California Adventure is wonderful too! The Tower of Terror is a great ride and again, the attention to detail is amazing! The new Carsland is also fabulous and the Racers ride was well worth the 2 hour wait! Can hardly wait to go again!",Disneyland_California,138

We went there during the week and not during school holidays, hardly any queue and so we just did the rides shows we really liked again and again. Our favourites (two adults and a 7 year old boy) are: evening firework show, Mickey's Philhar Magic, Mystic Manor, Grizzly mountain mine cars & buzz light year. What I also like about HK disneyland is you can get some proper food here.

Then the Indiana Jones ride broke down. So, I went to City Hall to complain about 3 out of the 5 thrill rides being closed. I wanted a partial refund. While I was there, the employee told me that Big Thunder had just opened an hour before I showed up at City Hall, and that Indiana Jones was now operational. Had I known about the closures, I would have made different decisions. That said, the employee was very understanding and gave us 3 Fast Passes for my family. So, that made up for the frustrations.

Considering it was the weekend before xmas it wasn't too busy either Having read some reviews I was aware that the food in the resort is expensive though I was still surprised quite how expensive we found the Golden Nugget to be the best value and nicest location for what we wanted some of the others were pretty nasty particularly the burger bar and the pizza restaurant. Our big disappointment however was the closing firework spectacular. We hung around in the cold and dark for a couple of hours to see the fireworks (the show starts at 10pm on Saturdays) but their was no firework spectacular there were no announcements and no apologies from the resort and we heard lots of other people complaining about their disappointment too. ,Disneyland_Paris,135

This park is much smaller and less extravagant but it is still amazing to see Disney in another culture. Getting there from the city was easy as they have their own subway stop (wait until you see their Disney themed subway car  it's amazing). The rides were fun, the food was good and the gift shops was full of really unique souvenirs. Overall we had a great time!

You have to do the Indiana Jones at least once. You should do the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Carribean and the log ride as well. If your group is a little older and are looking for pure ride experience you would likely do better at something like Six Flags or Knots Berry. We went on a week day and I thought it would be a little quieter...it wasn't. Lot of people just walking around so I found it congested and tiring. Space Mountain wasn't working and neither was the jungle ride but I guess upgrades and maintenance are required. ",Disneyland_California,133

For those that are struggling with whether to take them their young children now or later. Honestly, just take them. Disneyland was magical and the perfect size park for our first go at Disney with our two year old. I would do it over and over again.

Tiny castle compared with other Disney parks around the world. Very busy but worth a visit for the Disney enthusiast. Perhaps 5 stars is over rated but then again it's Disney and you can't really fault it. Food in park was nice, not just standard burgers, instead they had pasta and curry on the menu, very nice.   40 entrance fee. My dissapointment was that there is nothing once you come out of the park, no shopping district. Also it takes an hour from central HK so you can't really pop back to hotel and refresh. We were tired so left at 4pm and didn't return as it would have meant another 2 hours on a train. ",Disneyland_HongKong,137
609408417,3,2018-8,Australia,"There were lots of people there. The fast pass system worked well, but there were lengthy delays. There were plenty of refreshment stands, with lengthy lines waiting for service; for example it took 45 minutes to get coffee. For older people there just was not enough shaded seating to take a break. The food was horrible, cold and stodgy by the time you made it through the lines. Planet Hollywood is the place to eat; good food and service.Tips for the high tourist times; prebook your fast passes, pay attention to the main shows AND ARRIVE 2 HOURS EARLY. Be prepared for lengthy wait times by having light snacks and drinks at hand. People sit to wait and when the shows start, they stand. The shows were very good, especially the grand finale, simply spectacular.",Disneyland_Paris,135

The wait times for EVERY ride is ridiculous...over an hour wait for the roller coaster. I regret not buying a front of line pass. There were hardly any restaurants and the ones that were open offered no vegetarian options which was a let down. Planet Hollywood had delicious veggie burgers but was very expensive and wait time for food was long. Two of the rides were closed which was disappointing. My advice is get there as early as you can, bring your own food. Plan out your day carefully and take in to consideration the wait times for rides.",Disneyland_Paris,127

The complex is out all by itself near Hong Kong. The park is in it's fifth year but still has trees as the primary background behind the castle. This is a park that could be seen in one day as long as that day is Monday   Thurday. Weekends are insane and not worth the trouble. Cost is not bad at can be found for less than other Disney parks.Plan to be there when the park opens. It will allow you to see more of the park even earlier in the day.

Great rides, no waiting for us. There was a little rain on the day we visited but not enough to discourage. Stayed all day, had 12 15 rides and enjoyed them all. The staff didn't fully accept the Disney smile philosophy    more than a few dour faces but different strokes.

The hotel is tired looking and not that clean, and public toilets are terrible! Disney fleece you for everything including wi fi charges by the hour and do not even provide coffee in hotel bedrooms   unlike EVERY hotel I have ever been to in the world?

I expected that, but Disney didn't let off the midnight fireworks (due to winds). The problem was that many people (with kids) waited to see the fireworks show. Wish they would have announced that it wasn't going to happen so we all could have done something different (like sleep and then get up early when it was less crowded). Same thing happened the following night, even though the winds were at 1mph. If you plan to see the fireworks, look to the weather report and then make plans ;).

The rides and all were ok since there was not much queue on a weekday, usually 10 25 minutes wait. However, food choices were limited for a family place. Food places were crowded and it was all about chips, hot dogs and burgers. After visiting the Disneyland in Hong Kong, I have much expectation about the finale show and because it was summer with long days, we waited till 11pm. The laser and fireworks show was rather disappointing with my 2 kids falling asleep in the midst of watching.

Mystic Point and the fireworks at 8 PM were amazing!Since it is a day long activity, you are bound to get hungry and thirsty. Yes, they do have food stalls and eatery and they yes of course they are relatively over priced.

This meant that by the time the Park had officially opened, on one morning we managed to do Space Mountain 4 times and Buzz 3 times! We liked to stay late too, and for 2 consecutive nights we headed over to Thunder Mountain at about 10pm (park closed at 11) and managed to ride it 5 time and 4 times respectively.

Wear comfortable shoes as well. Come early so you can make the most out of the rides. We stayed there until closing time and we still wanted more of it!

We had purchased some kids meal vouchers from Klook which ended up being a waste of money. There are only a few locations you can use them and only 1 meal option at each so not a lot to chose from.

I was expecting the worse when it came to meeting Disney characters let alone getting a picture taken with them. But the park has the best set up. As soon as the characters came out, a cast member would form a line and everyone would get a turn. It was such a great experience. We are definitely making plans to go again next year.

Dropped a point for the cost of bottled water which as the weather was in the high 20's we drank a lot. Cost us a fortune.

Make time to see the evening parades but make sure you secure your place along the parade route early as it is always really crowded even on days when the park is quieter. As you can get a pass out on your daily ticket people often return to the park for the nightly parades.The park was spotless and kept in immaculate condition which has been the case on our previous visits. Hope we are lucky enough to be able to visit again.",Disneyland_California,120

Packed full of Disney magic its almost impossible not to have a fantastci time and feel like a child all over again. We ahd four full days in the parks and still loads left to do.Top tip 1   Fast pass Buzz Lightyear and PeterPan at the beginning of the day as queues are really longTop tip 2   Take children to the toilet before queueing to see Mickey, loads of entertainment in theatre so wait is not too bad, but very frustrating to stand in line and then hear  Mummy I need a wee wee!!!!! Toptip 3   Visit at christmas, magucal all year round but christmas is extra special with the tree lighting ceremony and santa cavalcade",Disneyland_Paris,127
290632005,4,2015-7,Australia,"Other than the HUGE crowds of people, the rides and attractions (such as the Alice in Wonderland maze) were great. The food was terrible   all very American and expensive. The merchandise was ridiculously costly (Micky ears were 25 euro), but other than the initial entrance fee, food and merch there weren't any costs. DEFINITELY worth buying a fast pass   this makes the whole day much, much easier. The only real disappointment other than the food prices was the fact Space Mountain and other rides on that side of the park were closed, despite it being peak season.My recommendations for anyone planning on going: 1. buy a fast pass.2. plan what you want to see beforehand.3. bring a lunch with you.4. get there early.5. go when it's raining!",Disneyland_Paris,127

More like a getaway for busy moms. A great way to spend quality time with the kids. The rides and the attraction aren't much but it's the ambience that makes it all ineteresting and worthwhile. Best time to go there is on November   Decmber when the temperature is not too cold nor too hot. Also, the park is equipped with kid friendly facilities so moms need not worry about their kids. It is also very accessible via the MTR which also has connecting tracks to the DIsneyland train...Snacks are available but it is better to go there with a full stomach since there isn't much variety to choose from.",Disneyland_HongKong,133

It was kept very clean , the staff were friendly and helpful and the prices for food etc were what we expected them to be (    3 for a bottle of water. ) . The free fast track passes are excellent and worth using . We spent 2 days at the park and it certainly wasn't enough time ! My only grumble would be the amount of people smoking out of the designated areas, but I know that is a problem at most theme park places. Overall I would advise anyone to visit here. We loved it !",Disneyland_Paris,126

But you can easily get such essentials anywhere within the Theme Park. As I travel with young kids (6 and 3), we tried everything that they could try.It rain in the evening around 6 7pm.

We went in November, so it was decorated for Christmas and as usual, was very magical   snow and all. The castle is fantastic and worth the trip. The rides are pretty much the same as California and Florida. The park is much smaller...we did both Disney and Hollywood Studios in about five hours. We went on a weekday, so not very crowded and easy to get in and out. If you've been to Florida or California and are expecting that same experience (especially with rides), you'll be disappointed.

We have been to 3 different parks now and I was very surprised at the paper on the floor, big puddles everywhere, broken toilets. The park was not crowded at all, so I could not see a reason for this.Also, the food venues are not as plentiful as other parks I have visited.

We opted to do it on the Monday as it was about    20 cheaper per person and couldn   t see the point in paying extra over the weekend especially when ques are probably at its highest. Any staff we dealt with where extremely friendly and helpful. The only thing that let it down where the ques. We where waiting on average about 40 to 50 minutes on the majority of the rides. We heard before hand that food is expensive so we brought a backpack with a few sandwiches crisps and bottles of water. Glad we did as people whereby kidding about prices.

Many attractions close by 2000 even though fireworks are at 2100. The positive was that there was not the crowds at all that Disneyworld sees and so no waiting for rides. (Longest was 30 mins) and that was rare. My teenagers rode hyperspace mountain 7 times. I am a huge Disney fan and so was glad we went however would not go back. ( I have been to Disneyworld 5 times and would return).

The government should use DL as a training ground for agents and police   these people are never rattled, always pleasant, and in complete control of the situation. The park is always fun, but it felt like there were more mechanical problems than ever. Several rides were going on and off often, we even got turned away in line a few times. But the Matterhorn was open and it was great.The Star Wars overlay was cool, but it changed Space Mountain a little too much for our tastes.

They sure did.I've never been wheelchair bound and have a new appreciation for those who aren't in them part time. I was pleasantly surprised by how accommodating the park was. When you're in a wheelchair, there are special lines and ways to get in and out of most rides. It's kinda like being a rockstar. Being July, it was hot as blazes but not humid like North Carolina, so it was bearable. Doesn't matter how old you are, it's worth it.

For the same price (350hkd), the park hours was longer and they added a few attractions such as the haunted house and zombies walking around the main st at night.My son and nephews enjoyed the buzz lightyear ride, jungle cruise, philhamagic and the lion king show.

There are good rides but the waits are lengthy and to be honest it just seemed like a huge shop...they are everywhere and overpriced along with the awful food. We paid 34 euros for two cheeseburger meals and 6 chicken nuggets!

From randomly meeting Captain Hook to repeatedly riding the cups and Dumbo rides to trying some of the bigger rides too, our toddler had a fabulous time, and so did we.

The queues weren't bad at all between 5 30 minutes so not much to complain about. There is a brand new Toy Story Land which is quite cool too!If you want photos with the princesses make sure you get there early as they are really strict with the times.

Lots of food parlous available. Plan your trip through this based on the timing of the shows. The brochure at the entrance, along with the tickets will give you the details of the show timings for the day. Enjoy the Disney parade.

Star Wars were a great hit and the queues endless for this attraction.Always look at fast passes for the applicable rides to reduce wait times and impatient kids.The only negative was that wish that there were a few more heathy choices for adults and a coffe shop as Starbucks queues were always long.If I could ask for one thing it would be having the fireworks during the colder times earlier as it is dark and little ones could stay awake to see them.Besides this we loved it and.a 5 day pass was enough however I am sure my kids would stay another 5 if we could.,Disneyland_California,123

The biggest frustration is that it is almost impossible for little girls to meet Elsa. They sell out less than one hour of the park opening, thus many kids are denied the opportunity to see their favorite character. With that much demand, you would think that they would set up a second location so more kids could be happy. My other observation is that the number of characters roaming the park have decreased over the years. Maybe the teens and adults don't care, but the little kids want to see the characters.",Disneyland_California,120
274931271,4,2015-5,United States,"Disneyland definitely delivers a great experience, but really should consider capping visitors or finding new ways to spread out the crowds. For example, parade routes could be longer, or they could run two parades at the same time in separate areas of the park to disperse crowds more. I fear it will take a small child getting trampled and seriously injured or worse before Disneyland conscientiously addresses this. Additionally, prices are ridiculous   how can an average, working class family afford to pay $32 for four hot dogs and four small bags of chips  no drink included?!? I know Disney has tremendous expenses for talented performers, spectacular fireworks, etc. Still, the profit margin is probably astronomical. There should be some way to at least offer a limited selection value menu, low cost soda or water refills, or similar consideration. ",Disneyland_California,138

We waited until evening when the rain cleared away to head to the park only to be told at the gate it was closing early. I had been watching the app for any info but there'd been no warning.

However, they then decided that my father was wheelchair bound, rather than needing support walking. This meant that he could not go on the Peter Pan or Pirates of the Caribbean ride until we returned and had it changed.

A lot of the rides that had animatronics had some that were not working (It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean).

257340203,3,2015-2,United States,"Went to Disneyland with my friends from Santa Monica, we were visiting from New York. I haven't been here in decades, and have been to Disney World quite a number of times so maybe my views were tainted. Overall I was underwhelmed. It was expensive to get in. The place was a madhouse. We waited on several lines, only to be told after waiting a good amount of time the ride was being shut down for mechanical difficulties. Space Mountain was constantly open and closed. The Castle was a back drop of a picture, which really was comical. I guess it was under construction. Several rides were not open. I just felt overall that I didn't get a lot for my money and was jipped! I gave it average, because my kids did have a decent time. I expected more!",Disneyland_California,140

Parking is easy and a quick stroll to the front gate, no need to ride the tram. Employees are welcoming and I love that you can carry in your lunch now (with some restrictions) when you are eating healthy a day at a theme park would be difficult if you can't bring some snacks, water and a light meal! Thanks Disneyland for allowing this option! I only wish that there was drinking fountain option that allowed you to refill a water bottle with filtered water, all water fountains we found had an aftertaste and one even had cloudy water.",Disneyland_California,120

We were able to walk from our hotel (Disneyland Resort) and either take the monorail in Downtown Disney or walk the rest of the way to the park. The entrance to California Adventure Park is right across from the entrance to this park, so it's really convenient if you have park hopper tickets. We really enjoyed Big Thunder Mountain and the Matterhorn. We loved the Light Parade as well. That is the perfect way to end your last night in the parks. It was very crowded, and the fast passes run out, so consider starting the day early and taking a break in the afternoon. Enjoy!",Disneyland_California,125
127572892,5,2012-3,Australia,"Great place for the kids. Two day pass better value. Loved the rides, the parade, the fireworks at night, the characters. Only downside was the waiting time and the amount of Asian adults and elderly people wanting to go individually on the kids rides so it makes the lines even longer. Cant believe the staff dont fill up the rides carriages etc to make the queues go quicker. We asked for our 2 kids to sit with another family to make the queues shorter and they looked at us as if something was wrong with us. It seems that kids adults from one family dont mix with other kids adults. so often the ride carriages have only 1 person in them. Otherwise we absolutely loved our days at Disneyland and especially our stay at the Disneyland hotel!",Disneyland_HongKong,137

They let people smoke in the park, people cut in line and the people who work there don't care! The service sucks, the employees are rude, and act like they hate their jobs! The park is dirty, the restrooms are small, AND dirty, there are very few garbage cans, and no benches to sit on, rides were closed or broke down often, and you can't get any information from anyone, because they just don't care.

The que time is the worst part and sometimes its just not worth the wait on some of the rides. Its seriously expensive, but I do love Casey's Corner hotdogs in the Park.

The disneyland park is very visually attractive , clean, and Expensive!! For example, popcorn costs about 6 9 euros... thats expensive!! Except for the roller coaster rides in every segment, all rides and attractions are aimed at kids about 5 9 yrs. Elder kids may not really enjoy the park as much as their younger counterparts. Also be prepared to stand in long queues for upto an hour, for popular rides.Nonetheless, we had a good time, but i guess my expectations were a notch higher , specially for slightly older kids and adults.(over 9 years).

We had discount coupons but still the ticket prices where about 80 euros each! very Expensive. Each park activity was pretty busy with a average 40 minutes waiting time on each. (Avoid weekends). Nevertheless the happiness in my sons face when Mickey Mouse hugged him is a magical moment. Most rides are for childrens but still its a bit of fun.There was 4 or 5 rides closed unfortunately due to maintenance. But still managed to go on every Single Ride Sighting activity. (About 15 or so). But I arrived Early in the morning 9am And left 9pm. Although quite expensive but Highly recommended.,Disneyland_Paris,134

I choose not to go inside because I have trouble walking for a long time and if you have been to any Disney Park there is a lot of walking involved. The cashier suggested I could rent a wheelchair to have someone push me but I traveled alone and even if someone had been with me I would not have asked them to spend a whole day pushing me around. The Metro and Trains stations in Paris were also a huge problem  endless stairs up and down and very few elevators.

Our first day in this dream come true happened to coincide with the locals last weekend to use their annual passes. NIGHTMARE! We left early and returned the next day when crowds weren't as bad, but still far more than should be in one park at a time. Attention to detail is mesmerising. Waltz dream is amazing. The Walt tribute hosted by Steve Martin brought a tear. Princesses were just beautiful and so engaging. Other staff were obviously overworked. Disneyland is not the happiest place on earth, it's the most crowded which is a real shame despite the long hours the park is open. Despite this we truly loved every minute.

You can collect them all. Cast members will wish you happy bday or anniversary.Use the free fast passes for the big rides. This is a great feature.Disney lets you bring in waters and snacks so use a back pack.Take one of the old fashion cars horse drawn trolley down main street.

Disney Studios next door which is included was brilliant too, really good theme throughout and fun rides. Tower of Terror by far the best ride. The biggest let down by far was food, very limited choice and costs alot. Nothing for Vegetarians at all and long queues for food. Water fountains very few and far between. We stayed in our campervan in their car park overnight with loads of other vans, toilets open all night but a bit of a walk, cost 30 Euros to park overnight but cheaper than surrounding campsites though its just a car park.",Disneyland_Paris,121

And some of the rides are quite old now and has not changed for some time. Our biggest disappointment was there was nothing from frozen? The biggest grossing film? Someone said it was big in florida disney? So it could be on it's way. Don't get me wrong it's still a magical place and I love it. My advice would be go in the week. ",Disneyland_Paris,121

Purchasing a ticket to just one of the shows they put on for free (Aladdin was AMAZING) would cost close to the entrance price to the park. Plus, Disney is not just a park with rides and characters walking around. It is almost inaccurate to described them as rides, they are definitely attractions with so many details. All of the characters you meet are awesome and each has their own unique autograph. While this is a once in a lifetime trip as it is pricey, it is worth it to save up and go. There are campgrounds with transport and a person could even save up air miles for park passes.",Disneyland_California,123

You'll have plenty of time for pictures and character meet ups if you do it this way. Use Fastpasses, they are a blessing, Bring bottled drinks as they cost around $4 for something that costs $1.50 outside the parks.

The park is considerably smaller than the ones in the U.S. with many the same attractions and layout. We did a quick train ride boarding at Main Street Station and briefly walk through Fantasy Land and Tomorrow Land. We did not try the rides in consideration of our ages. Overall, it was a nice visit but nothing special for us. It was easy to get to the park via MTR to Sunny Bay Station and change to the Disneyland Line (Pink Line).",Disneyland_HongKong,126

My son is autistic and without the priority shown to him with his disabled pass he should have had meltdowns in all the mad queues for rides. Unfortunately though, the Mad HattersTea Cups, Big Thunder Mountain, and Space Mountain were all being fixed when we tried to go them. They were out of action for most of the day. We were staying there for 3 days, but if you'd only had a one day pass this would have been much more annoying to find that the more popular rides weren't running at certain times. Maybe it's coincidental, but it made me wonder whether they close these rides routinely during off peak days in order to service them. ",Disneyland_Paris,129

It was so cold we decided to get some food, what an experience queuing in the theatre building near Space Mountain! Lunchtime, shelves empty, one till serving two lines of VERY grumpy people took over an hour, food was lousy once we eventually!! Found a seat. 14 euros for a burger, fries, brownie and coke.

I was disappointed that it was so hard to find a good spot for the parade though. That needs to be readdressed. For the price you pay to get in there there is no reason why you need to waste your time and go snag a seat 45 mins before the parade begins. That time could be used to check out the park. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique if you have a little girl. We also did the Halloween party. I wouldn't spend the $$ to do that again. ,Disneyland_California,128
508101644,3,2017-8,New Zealand,I was really looking forward to HK Disney for my daughter's 5th birthday but felt a bit let down by the experience. The queues were too long and there were no princesses or charterers to be seen except at the end in the parade. The staff were not very cheerful and people pushed in all the time in the lines. They should have a priority queue for people with young kids as it seems unfair that all these adults are taking up the queue space while kids have to stand exhausted in the lines. Also the Disney characters were nowhere to be seen. Standing in queues with small children for a 5 minute ride is not that fun! Still my daughter enjoyed it!

When you get into Disneyland at 0900 head to the left and go to Adventureland and do Indiana Jones ride and Pirates of the Caribbean first. Keep going around that way and you will find you will do most of the rides on that side before the crowds. We could have done Disneyland in the day. Definitely try the Pineapple Dole Whip at the Enchanted Tiki Room (the show there is good too). Use the Fast Pass if the lines start to get to 40  minutes wait.

But over the last 13 years, Disneyland added new games into this tiny one. By now, I would say, Disneyland in Hong Kong is not big but good enough for 1 to 2 days if you have 1 or 2 kids to play with. I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland about 4 to 5 times.

It was a memorable trip and we loved Disneyland, however the main train that goes around Disneyland was closed and that mean't my elderly parents had ALOT of walking to do.

I've been going to Disneyland since I was 5, and I still love the theme park. It has grown drastically over the years, to include California Adventure, and Downtown Disney. Personally, I love California Adventure, but Disneyland is a better choices for travelers who just have one day. Disneyland offers way more attractions than California Adventure. Disneyland is an older park, but it still amazes me, because it is very clean. Employees clean the whole park every night after the crowd leaves, and yes there will be a crowd everyday, because it is a very popular park.

The toy story land was not as interesting as the one I went in Tokyo. Also the were not many rides though it was a new section. Disney service staff was also not as friendly as previously.

We were ushered around the park in circles for over an hour and were not allowed to stand anywhere, especially not on Main Street to watch the fireworks. Countless parents with strollers (granted, they shouldn't really be there so late at night in my opinion) were screaming and trying to get out because it felt so unsafe.

Everything was amazing and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I went in January so there wasn't huge lines and the weather was fine (cold, but not freezing and it only drizzled rain a few times) but this would obviously be variable. In my opinion is was definitely worth braving the slightly poor weather to escape the massive crowds. Prices are high, but you know that is going to be the case, it's Disneyland. There are plenty of ways you can avoid spending, bring prepacked lunches and snacks, all the attractions are free, and if you are bringing kids just don't take them into any of the shops!",Disneyland_Paris,139

Got stuck on Thunder mountain for an hour after queueing for an hour had to be rescued out only to be given a fast track ticket which I still have. Queued for Michael Jackson X0 only to be told it had broken down. Watched tourists jump barriers whilst staff just watched one family even lifted their buggy over a fence and climbed over to secure a place on the parc train. Moving travelators to get in and out of the park were broken. The best part about the whole holiday was Disney Village which is free to enter had a nice evening watching entertainment in the sunshine. ,Disneyland_Paris,131

Breakfast turned out great! We loved it at Carnation Cafe. The menu was good, price was fantastic $9.99 was the most expensive breakfast set and there was Mickey Mouse waffles in the kids menu for $5.99   with strawberries and a drink. We were glad we made reservations. The line for breakfast was really long. For the rest of the time, we ate at several eating areas and restaurants around the park and they were all reasonably priced and of good quality. They all had really good kids meals! I particularly loved the funnel cake and the chocolate fudge sundae for dessert.",Disneyland_California,133

Lots to see and do, food isn't really cheap but if you're going here and expecting them to be, more fool you. Plenty of shops to buy some bits and lots to do.Lovely seeing people dressed up as the characters wondering around and getting interactive with everyone and not just kids.

I was thankful that for the most part Disney did a good job of providing shade for their guests while waiting in the lines. A few of the older rides broke down, but they were back up and running in time for us to be able to ride them before leaving the park. My 7 year old daughter says that she liked it all except the ride with the abominable snowman (The Matterhorn. It was pretty rickety.), lol. We also saw the Frozen show, and as another reviewer said, it was very good. I'm so glad we had the opportunity to visit!",Disneyland_California,130

We had a lot of fun here and there was something for everyone   from the youngest right through to adults   they all found something they enjoyed amongst the rides. We went just before Christmas so it was really busy and the queues for the restaurants at lunchtime were long   as were some of the rides as not all of them have fastpass options. It's a matter of keep going back to the rides to see if the queues have quietened down during the day. The light show that they do each evening was absolutely amazing and thoroughly recommended. There are also several parades during the day and opportunities to have photos with the characters. Good fun for everyone.,Disneyland_Paris,137

That alone made the trip worthwhile. We spent 8 hours there and covered most of the park had to offer. There is a halal food outlet as well which is certified by the Hk islamic council.The rides was nothing great but the shows e.g. The parade and festival of lion king was terrific. A must see is the spectacular firework at closing time. Wonderful fireworks! We booked a room at the disneyland hotel but only stayed there for sleeping i.e. From 8pm to 10am. Next time i wont book the hotel and would rather go back to the city as the park is very accesible via many modes of transport!,Disneyland_HongKong,135

Even though it was a long time ago, some things remain familiar.. such as the main st, the railway and fantasy land. The facilities are still good, the selection of products to purchase have changed and increased in number. The wait for rides seems to be much longer than before and basically too long for people of my vintage. A lot of people with not a lot of time for each other, so dodging and weaving is required to get around and prays, pushers are used as a weapon of choice to get through the crowd. As an adult it's wasted a bit on me, but I can see why children love not only the rides, but the whole experience. For family's it is recommend ",Disneyland_California,139

At 9:00am there was a 1 2 hour wait on rides but by 11:00am it was up to 75 minutes and the Fast pass was even worse (got Fast Pass tickets at 10:45am for Space Mountain and they were for 15:30pm! Then we couldn't get any more passes until 12:45pm so had to spend walking around doing nothing or line up for hours and wait for other rides. Food, drinks and souvenirs were expensive and there were no entertaining shows like you get at Universal Studios. I have no idea what people do here for 3 days   we couldn't even fill 1 full day.

You can fast pass but they are only available at certain times. You can get more than one at a time aswell but I think you have to wait an hour or so. The fireworks were okay but nothing compared to Florida. The light parade was amazing! A must see! Was quaint but busy park. Downtown Disney wasn't much to see, city walk was better.

The park is beautifully landscaped, and everything has details down the the tiniest thing. I appreciated that so much more this time. I do hate the crowds though and it is very expensive to visit, but again the details make it obvious why. The best times were during Magic Mornings, and early until around noon. After that the crowds were unbearable. This was a great month to visit (May) because the temps were low and we didn't get too hot while in the park, plus most kids were still in school so it was even less busy than normal.",Disneyland_California,126

The small things such as wishing our kids happy birthday when seeing their badge to free cupcakes and candles. Things kids won't forget. The lines were long and often impatient kids couldn't handle it. Make the most of early entry and at least 1 day with fast passes. Days were long but so worth it. Loved the freedom of the 5 day pass and being able to come and go as the kids got tired. Fireworks are a must but get a spot early as they don't let you stop and watch if anywhere near a walk way.

Whole areas of the park were closed, forcing the oversold crowds to the few existing attractions. Lines were overwhelming and the fast passes were no longer being issued. Nothing seemed to be of Disney's high standards. We decided to salvage our visit by going to a restaurant or getting food of any kind. Everything was closed. It was expensive and not worth the drive to get there. Don't go if you're American and have been to any of Disney's American Theme parks. You will be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris,134

The Dole Tiki Birds not so much, they have changed the format to make it bigger but I liked the old style better.Ate an overpriced lunch and was always struggling to find seating in the shade.My advice would be to go early, get out early and plan your rides ahead of time.",Disneyland_California,128

I bought three of them and two tore, so had to buy another two the second day I was there. Also, I had to buy a pair of children's welly boots, they were 25 Euros, what a rip off!

I have been in the park about 45 times in the last 57 years. I have 23 grand children and we will not be coming again. It is a shame that GREED took over the park.

The Disney experience with the Asian touch is really spectacular. I'd recommend making the most of the fast pass, which you can use once at every ride (no additional cost).We were able to get through the entire park in one day, but it was a very busy day   non stop.

Terrible outfits for the staff which added to the outdated rides and jobsworth idiots dressed up as Disney characters running away from guests rather than embracing them.A lot of the place was being refurbished so rides like space mountain were not an option.

The value was good, and for anyone from Australia wishing to take their children to Disneyland, I don't think you could go wrong taking them here if you don't have the budget to go to America.

Understanding that this is the end of the season, but many rides and resturants were closed or closed very early.

I love how they let you take snacks in that also saves you money plus you get a discount from your annual pass.

However don't go here expecting a carbon copy of other Disney parks. Mystic manor was a great ride that is unique to this park. Another plus is the almost nonexistent lines at space mountain.

Though you have been been still you will not feel board. We all enjoyed this so.........much though we have been to other Disney parks. We never felt enough. Kids wanted to go on and on in the same rides. But to rejoin through the long queues is not easy. May be a ride is 5 minutes but sometimes have be on queues for 30 minutes. There was lots of restaurants and food outlets and also washrooms. This is not such a large one as the one in California, neither more shows, but still wonderful........specially in the spring I guess",Disneyland_Paris,120

The food was ok we had dinner at the Pirate of the Caribbean restaurant and it was good food and not too expensive. The smaller snack shops were a pure robbery a simple  film  Swedish term for having a coffee break would set two people back 15 20 EUR that would include two cups of coffee and two cakes. Other than that I personally felt like I was 7 again and had quite fun the bigger rides were a good thrill and we had an amazing evening with the final show at 11pm. ,Disneyland_Paris,128
148696876,3,2012-12,United States,"The park was fun, but very crowded. They actually closed, refusing entrance for hours because of too many visitors! The attractions were close together due to the small size of the park. Although this could be seen as convenient, the crowds of people made it a long journey from one ride to the next. The rides were fun, but ticket holders are only allowed one fast pass every two hours. We were able to ride everything, over the course of two days. We opted to eat at tomorrow land terrace. The food was okay, but it took over 35 minutes for us to get our food! keep in mind, this is a walk up fast food dining option. I'm glad to have experienced the park, but wouldn't return....I'll continue to visit magic kingdom and Orlando Disney instead.",Disneyland_California,137
284070569,5,2015-6,Australia,"We visited Disneyland from Australia with a seven and a ten year old. It was a fabulous experience. A five day pass with one one day of five devoted to California Adventure park was perfect.While not cheap, it is not astronomically expensive either, once you have paid for the flights from Australia of course. We enjoyed every minute, staying for the parade and fireworks on two nights. It was an emotional experience as my wife and I grew up watching Disney on TV once a week and being there as adults returned us to those days. My wife even cried as we watched the fireworks burst over the castle. A magical experience that far exceeded my high expectations.Best holiday of my life and I would give ten stars if possible.",Disneyland_California,130
663791913,1,2019-4,United States,The max pass worked ok for Disneyland but not California Adventure. All the fast passes are gone within a few hours so it is a waste. The new system has doubled the wait times in the stand by lines because as they will tell you  fast pass riders have priority.  Under the old system you pulled a fast pass ticket for free. When you time to use it came you stood in a short line. While you waited for the fast pass time you stood in a line. Now you either stand in a line for fast pass if you can get one or you stand in a line with a few hour wait time. This was all a scheme for Disney to make more money and in the end it made things worse as far as wait times go.,Disneyland_California,140

So what when the ride could only accommodate 2 persons. Get in line like other people coz everyone paid the ticket. They need to checked on this.Anyway weather was good...clear with cool breeze. Availability of new halal food outlet really helpful for muslims. A little bit pricey but guess what..it's Disneyland. Newly opened Grizzly Gulch was awesome while other rides were equally good as well i.e space mountain, river cruise, small world etc. Parade of Disney characters were held at 12.30 & 3.30pm in front of Fantasyland.

As the title states, many of the attractions were closed for maintenance or remodeling and will be for many months. The ones that were working were overcrowded and prone to breaking down. We got stuck in the haunted mansion for about 20 minutes and Buzz Lightyear was stop and go. Peeling paint and tattered banners. Not the level that one would expect from the Disney name. Too few staff and too many guests. Even though attractions were reduced, the admission prices were not. No reason to go here.

Did the rides, ate there and stayed for the night parade and fireworks. Well worth it. Arranged for a tour to collect us from hotel. This way didn't have to worry about trains and buses and lining up for tickets. and the best thing was that the bus was waiting at the entrance to take you straight back to hotel   especially after a long day at the park.

A great spot to watch is A Small World especially for the first Parade as that is the starting spot. Get there about 30 minutes before it starts. The fire works is the best that I have ever seen. Get a spot on the centre and middle of Main Street about 20 mins before it starts. It is well worth the wait. The rides are typical but many closed for refurbishment and the building of the new Star Wars area. Updates to Space Mountain and Star Tours are great. Launch Bay had some amazing stuff. Worth a look. Get there early and stay there late. Make the $100.00 day worth it. Disney rarely disappoints.,Disneyland_California,132

Mickey fantasmic 4D show. End with a 7pm parade of light then with the fireworks at 8:30 pm to closing.

First off, Main Street is wider here than in CA which is nice to navigate through the crowds. Also, behind the Main Street shops are arcades with plenty of nice things to look at. I hate to say it, but this Space Mountain is also better. There never seems to be a long line and the ride incorporates loops and an initial launch. Another cool feature is the Disney Hotel is right over the entrance to the park. However, there is no New Orleans Square and I feel like the layout in CA is just better. ",Disneyland_Paris,124

We were there for my granddaughters 3rd birthday. She was dressed as Cinderella.

The place it`s very scenographic and there are some stunning attractions (don`t miss  it`s a small world  and  pirates of the Caribbean ). The queues are a bit annoying but some can be jumped taking a  fastpass  ticket that pratically books you at a specific time. To be honest I expected to find more  characters  going around. By night the view is spectacular and don`t go away before watching the show of lights and fountains around the castle.

The food was good, prices not bad, views great, fun people and great servers, clean restrooms, what I expected and more. No complaints but now I know. You should be prepared to watch sports and eat and that is about it. If you want to chat, go outside. They do have some private rooms so maybe it is quieter in those? I would go at least once just to see and then have a Haagen Dasz afterwards on the way to the park entry. parking is free with purchase too which I thought was a great concept...",Disneyland_California,123

The fireworks at the end of the night were spectacular, and really ended our long day quite well. I really praise the cast and crew of The Lion King show   they did an amazing show and are exceptionally talented. I also really enjoyed the Tarzan boat ride around the tree house.

The streets are themed, the characters are floating around (kind of   I expected to see them everywhere, but they weren't and you have to queue to take a picture), there are food stalls and restaurants catering to all types of meals and budgets (still fairly pricey though).Although all the rides you see on TV are there and you get to finally ride them, I was surprised at how washed out some of the areas of Disney looked   especially the castle. Some things are looking a little aged and need a good paint or re vamp. The rides are defiantly catered to younger children. Not thrill seekers. If you're more into fun,thrill seeking rides, spend time at California Adventure. Tip  get fast track tickets to space mountain, the best ride at Dismey. ",Disneyland_California,139

Definitely worth the price of admission.,Disneyland_California,133

We stayed from about 11   7 and saw everything we wanted to. It was a magical great day. We highly recommend the shows   both lion king and the golden mickeys. The parade was great too. The rides were ok but we knew going in that this Disneyland is not geared to adrenaline rushes. Im a big kid so i loved the fantasy of the place and reminded me of my childhood. I would return! The only negatives are the other tourists   they can be so rude and pushy. The food is exxy but as long as you prepare for it thats ok. ,Disneyland_HongKong,134

Disney pulled out all the stops and the park had extra magic hours for everyone. We left the park after 11pm on two of the nights. There were also extra celebrations for the 25th anniversary so we got good value for money. Loved the stars on parade and the closing ceremonies.

I think the longest we waited was about twenty mins.Grizzle Gulch the newest area of the park and boy what a fun roller coaster.They are adding another area to the park due to open next year I think.

My main issue was smoking in public areas. While this is the cultural norm in France, it is banned in the park with designated smoking areas in place. However, the rule is not enforced at all so expect to have people smoking all over the place which is uncomfortable when you are crowded together in queues or when watching parades. I saw people smoking right in front of other peoples children and cast members who did nothing to enforce the no smoking policy. When I mentioned it to guest relations they told me that they has been instructed not to enforce the policy so as not to upset their majority smoker customer base. ",Disneyland_Paris,136

Make sure you use Fastpass to speed past the queues. Go to the big ticket rides during the parade as that's the quiet period for rides. NOTE you can't take your own food in so eat well before you go as food is a little pricy. Overall a good experience but if you have older kids they'll want bigger and more scary rides.

The workers lacked personality, and I even saw one waving and smiling at a car full of passengers about to take off on Space Mountain, and after it was launched he looked at another worker and rolled his eyes. Not impressed... That would not fly at home!! During the firework show there are ZERO workers to be found. No parade control or anything.

Unfortunately, the one problem we had was a last minute stop on the Jungle Cruise where we waited 40 mins or so and were told it was 'close to closing' and they'd taken boats off!!

The fast passes were good but the times quickly ran out so use them wisely. Get on the new Toys ride as quick as possible as the queue for this was crazy long!!

Of course adults can try the rides too like what I did and the best I think was the Space Mountain.You can also watch the parade of Disney characters and your pictures taken with them.

If you are hear for multiple days you can work around it but is extremely frustrating if you just spent 45 mins in line just to be turned away.

Yes everything is expensive and yes the lines are long but just go there and enjoy the sights and sounds and memories you will take home of the joy in your kids, grand kids or significant others eyes. Worth every dollar. ",Disneyland_California,137
236987257,5,2014-10,New Zealand,"I returned to Disneyland after 20 years, but this time with a six year old. She was enthralled, as were we. Watching her face was the best part! We loved Ariels Grotto, Alice in Wonderland, Pirates of the Caribbean, Maters Racers, Bugs Life, but especially Pixie Hollow. World of Colour was brilliant, fireworks great, and the Frozen pre parade made up for not wanting to queue for hours to see Anna and Elsa! Really loved the Soundsational Parade. Queues as a whole weren't too bad, the longest we waited was 45 mins for Alice in Wonderland, but we didn't even try to go on the bigger scarier rides. Only waited about 5 min to see Mickey Mouse, and about 20 to see Minnie.",Disneyland_California,123

Value for money not there, even with California Land(half open, waste!!). My wife and I were here 21 years ago... not much has changed.... Food was REALLY expensive... better off leaving the park and returning later. Considering that the place is full nearly all year round, the food is so over priced. Disney must be struggling these days.... Not only they slug you $150 $175 US (3 days) then expect you to spend around $30US a day to drink & feed yourself...I call it a RIP OFF!! kids enjoyed it... But went hungry until we got out of the theme park... and ate just over the road at a third of the price.",Disneyland_California,129

We got to the park at 1Pm visited both Parks and left by 6:30pm and the total cost with tickets for 4, meals, souvenirs etc.... We spent $1200. Kind of crazy. But we do EVERYTHING for our kids.

The light shows, the fireworks and parade were so much fun! It was just me and my boyfriend (no kids) and there was so much to see and marvel at without riding any of the rides.

Plus the updated Star Tours ride, which incorporates all the new movies and settings. Absolutely amazing.Also I have noticed Space Mountain, Matterhorn Bobsled, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, has been tweaked to keep up with all the new changes at DCA. There   s also single rider options available, great if you want to ride but the kids are old enough to look after themselves.

The Frozen Village was up to 3 to 4 hour wait. We were lucky went there first when the park opened & got into see the 10am show so only had to wait about 50 mins. The show was so perfect for our grand daughter. Then The Lion King Show was excellent as was the ride through It is a small world & for the scary try Mystic Manor a great ride.

Rides that my son loves: it s a small world, casey jr circus train, storybrooke canal boats, the regular monorail, main street train and the carosel of progress in tomorrowland.

We did not wait longer than that for every ride, so we were able to go on all the large rides in a morning!

The rides are fun, although not many are  thrill rides.  My family and I especially loved the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The beginning of the ride is quite different from the one in Disney World. I HIGHLY recommend at least one character dining experience if you have a little one. They are pricey, but the looks on your child's face will be worth having sandwiches the rest of the trip.

No magic,godawful food and only a few rides worth riding.But the worst bit by far is the French. Now we all know the French aren't known for their smiley nature and good customer device,but they really did make stereotypes ring true here.

The Southern California weather adds to the whole experience of having an enjoyable day. The lines can get long if you don't go at the slower times of the day year, and the food can be pricey, but if you want to enjoy yourself just throw it all on the credit card and worry about it later.

Used the fast pass option to help with waiting times in line. Stayed in a nearby hotel so we could walk back and forth from Disneyland to California adventure and hotel for midday lunch or swim. Got tickets ahead of time so coyld enter the park and enjoy every minute. Fantasyland is wonderful for adults and kids alike! Fireworks are a must see.

Lots of walking and a very long day to be expected. The staff were friendly and the rides were great. It is impossible to avoid shopping and as expected the food is overpriced. We visited in winter which may be the reason the queue's were reasonable. Buy your tickets online and you might find a good deal as we did. The best fireworks and light show we have ever seen although by then the kids are exhausted. Shopping and dining outside the gates in the Disney Village was great after the park closed.

Buy everything inside the park. You get to Skip with the mass of people with bags and strollers going through bag check. You walk through the hand body scan and you   re moving in!Spend at least two days in Disneyland if it   s peak season especially now they   ve changed the Fast Pass system.

The cues are HUGE and during lunch many of the counter service restaurants were shut and at snack time the icecream and other snack counters where shut! where is the sense in that? but the park is great, my kids enjoyed it a lot! ** was it just us or do they not have enough characters roaming around?

The ones that did have a larger queue (which were hardly any) we either did in Magic hours time, or fast passed it.

The signs are misleading at best; they really need to put up signs or post some cast members outside in the morning. The second thing we noticed was the reliability of the rides not being up to standard. Buzz Lightyear stopped several times, once for an extended period.

I hate to admit it but I was starstrucked when I saw Mickey and Minnie! :) I recommend getting there early so you can enjoy all the rides and maximize your time.

I think you have to pick the time of the year to visit, avoid the peak times as it would be unbearable and the queues monumental. A must see is Fantasmic and the train ride around the park to get an overall view of the various lands.

The gardens of course are very well kept. I think one thing that makes this park so different from the others is the characters they focus on.

Cons: expensive whether it's a single park multiple days ticket or a multiple days hopper tickets. To top it off, staying at the Grand California hotel was not cheap too (however, I liked that we had easy access to the park), lines are always long, waited 50 minutes for peter pan ridiculous), food and drinks expensive, everything pricey!!

The buildings had paint peeling, the bathrooms were atrocious. trash was all over the grass and walkways and the service was rude. There is no way this would be tolerated in an American Disney resort. It takes away from the magic of the place to see things so dirty and to encounter so many surly  cast members .

All the food outlets and restaurant's we visited were very poor (food and service). I suppose it is a French thing but I hate seeing smoking in the park especially when you are eating.

Fast passes definitely make the difference in being able to ride more and see more. Unfortunately you can only hold one fast pass at a time so with a quick review of the park map and a little bit of time spent on a little bit of planning you can definably fit more into the day.

Food outlets, rides (mainly for younger kids) like dumbo, tea cups and cars show which apparently was shut for 3 weeks and added to the closed list. This is the main reason we went! My son loves lightening McQueen and Spider Man. That   s the other let down. You have to book to see Spider Man which I couldn   t do for 3 days staying. As soon as you log on the app it   s all booked! We went for a trip on the boat in Adventureland and this had a technical fault too so couldn   t go on that!

There was barely a ride he couldn't go on it was great. I don't think there were many height restrictions at all and even if there was as long as you were on the ride it wasn't a problem. We spent 3 days at Disneyland Paris and 2 of those days in the main park. I wish we hadn't bothered with the studios park as that ones not really for his age range as there are about 2 rides he can go on. So if you have a toddler less ham a metre tall stick in the main park. ,Disneyland_Paris,128

Not too crowded, I think we waited 30 minutes tops for the longest line. They have some places that offer vegan options, have to ask. I ate at the Village Haus and got the veggie burger with no sauce. It does get crowded on Main St for the fireworks and is horrible trying to make your way out after the fireworks are over.

The cute atmosphere is great, and the cast members are always kind and helpful! The whole park is adorable, and the atmosphere is very fun. This park takes me back to my child hood! The main tip is to get there right as it opens and go straight to the back of the park. You will get the park to yourself in the back areas for the first half hour if you hurry. The Grysley Gyser drink by Grysley Gulch is amazing, as are the fish and chips! Try the fish balls (Yue dan), they are authentic Hong Kong food, and I personally love them.",Disneyland_HongKong,128

We liked Paradise Pier because it is less expensive than the other two properties and is closer to the parks than the Disneyland Hotel. At the park, the train ride gives an overall view of the park. We like some of the quiet attractions   Moments with Mr. Lincoln on Main Street, the steam boat ride around Tom Sawyer's Island and It's A Small World.

I've been to Walt Disney world with large crowds, but I was never pushed and shoved like I was in Hong Kong. I guess I woulds have to chalk it up to a different culture of most of the guest. That being said, if you have never been to a Disney Park, than you should still visit this one if you get a chance. It has that Disney magic, you can't find at any other park.

We found Mickey Mouse and queued about 1hr 40 minutes for a picture. Much the same for Pluto, Buzz & Woody over 2 days.

In fact I don't even want a burger, I don't want to sit and have a fancy meal, I just want a sandwich. They have a few locations doing fruit, pickles, potato chips, mainly snack things that you quickly grab. Why can't they add some pre packaged sandwiches to that?

It was very tight and cramped compared to Magic Kingdom. The pathways were a constant battle to get through. The attractions were very well done, but being used to Magic Kingdom it was a bit of a shock to see cast members walking around in the wrong lands or with food in there hand on the Haunted Mansion.

Some rides felt a little tired and when problems developed and rides closed you were basically just moved on with no acknowledgement that you may have been queueing for an hour. Many staff did not appear interested, some a little rude. It was good in the main, the available rides were all good fun and the kids enjoyed it.

You can then spend the first two hours or so racing from attraction to attraction, avoiding the crowds that will descend soon after. Rides that built long lines quickly were: Peter Pan's Flight, Finding Nemo Subs, Indiana Jones, all the Mountains (Splash, Big Thunder, Matterhorn), and Star Tours.

I guess its the American gun culture but I didn't like that for my 3yr old. We waited 30mins to see princesses but only 10 people in front of us and we had to leave the line to see the Frozen play.

We eventually could not keep up although several times we thought we were in a line formed for pictures.

But we realized that for an elderly person there were not enough sitting places. In addition all the cafes were more of fast food type. And a good quality restaurant doesn't exist. However the major problem is the queues to the attraction. People spend more time queuing than having fun.

I loved the New Orleans themed area and we had dinner at the Blue Bileu which was fantastic and I wound highly recommend it. (Try the Lousiana lemonade!!)I managed 13 hours of walking which is incredible and says a lot about how much fun we had. Wear comfy shoes and prepare for a big day of walking for a truly magical experience. ",Disneyland_California,139

If you have never been you should come atleast once and if you don't like it then good luck finding anywhere better that not in europe.

Disney, Why did you crank up the volume to what appears to be rock concert loud? I do not recall this being a problem in the past.Disneyland is a great family fun destination. I do recommend a good set of ear plugs!!The price appears to be on the high end, it is just under $100 per person per day. Disney may keep their admission price high, to prevent hitting their capacity limits.

Make sure to take a map at the entrance so you would know which places you wanted to go. You wont be able to see everything in just one visit so I'm hoping to go back there.

I suggest read about the rides in the park before hand and choose one park if you only have one day to spend here. I must say this is one place in Paris where most of the staff can speak English! :)Overall, one can never get enough of Disneyland, where dreams come true!!Can't wait for my next trip!",Disneyland_Paris,139

In the park everyone was nice the rides are amazing! Our fav ride was space mountain! It's so fast and 3D it's like you are really in the sky! It's a must go! I would recommend it!

Before we came we did our research so we knew about closure of some rides and we were perfectly fine about that. Only thing DLP has to improve is character interaction. I mean characters are lovely but sometimes hard to meet&greet. We were very lucky to meet everyone my daughter likes but it was loads and loads of queuing. We booked lunch in ADC so she could see princesses there, which was perfect for her but overpriced. Frozen sing along was brilliant! All Frozen summer is just lovely!!!!!

Take a map and schedule of the shows with you or else you won't be able to catch up with time. Queues for the ride I'd say moderate given that I went on a Saturday afternoon. Don't expect too much for the indoor roller coaster rides. In my opinion, they were anti climax.

There are so many things to see and do at Disneyland and you can't do it all in one day visit.

The changes to the Pirates ride were great but the holiday changes to the Haunted Mansion ruined the experience. The other rides were predictable with no changes. The Innovation display wasn't worth the time. I was disappointed that the Indiana Jones ride was down for repair. In general, I think the Park needs some work.

126097675,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Ok so perhaps a little strong but you have to realise that the main aim of the park is to extract as much money as they physically can from you with minimal effort. Water 2.99 euros. Food mediocre. Rides, short, Queues long. 80% of staff friendly. Toilets difficult to spot. Too many grownups (why are they on childrens rides??). Ban smoking. A number of rides restaurants out of action (refubishment)   understand but just shut the park for the week or offer discounts!Best value place we ate was Pizza Planet as you could have as little or as much as you wanted (we also did California Grill, some Steakhouse place, New York Hotel).Kids liked the whole experience but as a parent will go to US next time as happier and more service orientated by nature",Disneyland_Paris,134
611272766,5,2018-5,United States,"You probably already know what you think about Disneyland, even if you have never been there. It is the platonic ideal of a theme park, even more than its counterpart in Orlando.The major negative is that it is almost constantly grossly over crowded. Disney has over sold its annual passports and does not effectively limit sales at the gate. I am not really sure why they do that, because the least crowded areas of the park are food stalls and retail stores. Everything else is so crowded that it really hurts the experience.That said, the Disney Magic is real. The hooks the park has into memories that you have of childhood and are able to share with your own children are amazing. Walt Disney designed an amazing place and it has generally been extremely well maintained.",Disneyland_California,136

We had heard from numerous people that Disneyland is so much smaller, and how Disney World is soooo much better, so we didn't go into it expecting very much. We were amazed and pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail there was throughout the park. Our first day, we kept comparing Disney land vs World, but by the 2nd day we stopped because things were just different, and you couldn't compare the two. We had a wonderful time, and enjoyed the rides that were new to us. Some of our favorites were Finding Nemo, The Matterhorn, and Indiana Jones.",Disneyland_California,122

It's very clean and the attention to detail, especially on the rides, is amazing. I do agree with a previous reviewer about the smoking though   it should definitely be non smoking; I had to ask one man not to drop his ash on my baby during a parade!Yes, of course it's busy but, on the whole, this is well managed, even when everyone is leaving the park after the show. Use the Fast Pass system on certain rides eg Thunder Mountain, Peter Pan and Buzz Lightyear.

More than anything else Disney parade, fire works, Chris tree lighting and meeting you favourite Disney character is an experience in itself. If you have a young kid then you are going to have a fielded day. One day is not sufficient to cover all fun. We visited it for 2 days. Covered fantasy land and tomorrow land on day one and adventure land, mystic land and toy land on day 2. Get Disney app to better manage things or else you will be just running around.

We booked tickets through Klook, which got us Auto magic access without any need to wait in ticket lines. Automagic is nothing but getting your printed tickets from a machine by using QR code on your Klook tickets. So we just walked in within no time. All attractions are very nice. But the highlight is Disney Character parade during the day and in the evening with fireworks. The only difference is that the parade songs are in Mandarin language. A must do attraction is R Racer in Toy Story land something very thrilling. Make sure that you occupy the benches in front of Castle at around 615 630pm. That's the place with the best view of evening parade and fireworks. ",Disneyland_HongKong,138

We knew for the second day and booked a table and World of a Color ticket in California park. It was absolutely amazing and a real must see for anyone on a trip to Disney.

This place was spotless with excellent rest rooms. All British theme parks could learn a lot from the ethos of Disney!! Queue times for rides aren't too bad and they seem to over estimate. For example we joined a queue that stated 45 mins but only actually waited 20 so that was great. You are also able to get fast passes for many rides at no extra cost. Again British theme parks could learn a thing or two!! I can't express how much fun we had. It was absolutely brilliant. Thanks for the memories. ",Disneyland_Paris,138

The park is magical and all done very well only real let down is the rude and arrogant staff. Clearly unhappy to be there, even the lady on guest relations was rude so think that sums it up. Ignoring the staff the attractions and park itself are very good. Queues vary depending on the time of year you go, however in November when we went they weren't a problem. Queuing to meet characters or buy merchandise was however a problem mostly due to French and Spanish guests who seem to have no issue with personal space for one and no issue with pushing in front of you. You will have a wonderful time once you get past these minor issues. ",Disneyland_Paris,134

The buffet we had though, while waiting for the closing program, had the best food inside the park. It can be pricey (28 euro adult and 16 euro for kids) but the food they served was really good and they have a good variety (seafood, meat, veggies, carbs, etc). I forgot the name but it is across the castle and probably is the biggest restaurant inside the park. Oh, and their staff is friendly. ",Disneyland_Paris,123

I expected this but did not expect the pushing and shoving and the excess number of strollers for a Thursday between 9:30 until 3:00 pm. All of us including my grandson were so glad to see the exit.

No need to book a hotel directly across the street from the entrance, as there are several bus lines & taxi are available right along harbor blvd. Plan to walk, bring plenty of snack foods in a backpack ( which will be searched) but this can save lots in the cost of theme park food. I suggest the most comfortable shoes, be sure to go to each land inside the park, I prefer the train, over the monorail, but take time to use both. The monorail was introduced in the late 50's foretelling at that time that this concept would be everywhere within 50 years. Unfortunately, it never took place.",Disneyland_California,124

He was wished Happy Birthday by all of the cast members we met. He loved it. I paid extra for the Max Pass and it was more than worth it. I have so many pictures to remember the trip.

For the first 2 or 3 hours the lines had wait times of about 30 45 mins. In the last 2 hours we were getting on within 5 mins. We managed to do everything in that time. Our only issu was that the whole park was so dark and not lit up it was impossible to read your map to work out what ride to go on. My tip is to download a map of the park beforehand and study it to work out what is where. Overall a great experience. Only about one third the size of LA Disneyland.,Disneyland_HongKong,130

Cannot stress this enough, and make sure you take rest breaks and drink plenty of water3 I would recommend fastpass as the lines get really long4 A few rides broke down before we could ride them so we missed out on a few.

The sewer system at both parks had issues so you were constantly smelling sewer. Their were 80 minutes wait for the popular rides. The Resort was filthy and the service bad.

Don't forget about bag check, get in the shortest line as it gets you to the same place. California Adventure is across the way from Disneyland so getting a park hopper is highly recommended as Guardian's of the Galaxy (Tower of Terror) and Incredicoaster (California Screamin') is there.

Also, costume characters are amazing, always present, good turn around time with reasonable queue time. Fast pass is fantastic unlike universal where you've got to pay extra cash.

The castle is cool, can go up on second floor where it tells story of Sleeping Beauty, and it has a dungeon with dragon. Color scheme is slightly different for castle and Main Street. They built more covered areas for rain. We loved it.",Disneyland_Paris,121
228926908,5,2014-9,United States,"Appreciated the extra security steps Disneyland takes. Felt totally safe. Every single employee (and there are many) are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask for help or directions. Took a few snacks along, but also enjoyed the Disneyland corn dog, mint julep, churros, ice cream, and other tasty treats. Take advantage of the Fast Pass, which is totally simple to use. If you're not sure how to use it, there are many employees around to assist. Disneyland is such an exciting place, but take a couple of breaks throughout your day to grab a drink and or snack, find a cool place to sit, and just people watch. Be friendly and chat with some other travelers. We met many, many nice people from all over the world. Have fun!!",Disneyland_California,131

Worth staying up that bit later to see. The rides were fun. Again busy but what else do you expect when you go in summer holidays. Little resturants dotted around the park, that you will pay a arm and leg for not the best tasting food but hey ho I think we lived off pop corn and Planet Hollywood which is in the Disney Village. A fantastic park and don't let the staff get you down as some of them are misrable but for most of them, they are lovely and helpful. Looking forward to returning and trying out the Disneyland hotel this year. ",Disneyland_Paris,131

The carousel also is fantastic.2. Waiting time for attraction is ok, ze just wait in the big ones max 45min, and is not a big deal for this kind of park3. Clean and Perfect, everything is shining! The bathroom too and in France is something really rareBad.1. It is cleary for children. Even if also adults HAVE TO go, the park is structured for children, a lot of attraction are studied for children, and really basic. I must say that some atraction are really disapointng for adults.Final tips. Go, even if you don't have child. Have fun and breath the disney magic all around!",Disneyland_Paris,127

Cool breeze of weather since we visited first week of February. Food by the way is too expensive. Huhuhuhu. Souvenirs too but bought something just for me to remember that I went there.

You can bring your own food and drinks to the park.I recommend getting sunscreen when you visit the park. Most of the rides were for kids and as we are adults, we didn't enjoy the rides. Last thing, don't forget to use your fast pass tickets which save you time. The machine locks you from getting another ticket unless 2hours passes after using the first ticket.

Make sure to take notes on the show time. All I can remember is LION KING at 12pm. Food was okay, not many choice but OK. Waiting time was also not long. So everyone was happy then.My fav ride: mining roller coaster...forgot the name, it is located in the jungle land area close to Lion King.Also, they provide rental for stroller.

A small world was closed (listed on the sign) however Pirates of the Carribean didn't open all day and big thunder Mountain until after 6pm due to 'technical issues'. The rides didn't have the same level of scare factor or the variety that Disney in California has, the food choices were also pretty limited.

We traveled to Disney World a few years ago over the same time period and even though there were definitely crowds, it was nothing like this year. The park was at 97% capacity on Tuesday! I HIGHLY recommend using your FAST PASSES wisely and getting them early in the day. FAST PASSES ARE NOT ADDITIONAL $$. They come with your pass (of any kind). USE THEM!!

The first line is to check your bag. I get that it is for safety, but I do not even carry a bag. There needs to be a line for people that are not bringing a bag onto property. The next line was the ticket line. How hard is it to buy a ticket, there is no reason that I need to wait in line for 20min with 5 people in front of me. The third line was the actual entrance, it should not take this long to scan a bar code. Get it together Disney",Disneyland_California,125

But the bad thing is the queue for the ride always take time, about 45 menit to 1 hour for every ride. This can make us exhausted. Disneyland management need to see and improve this kind of this. And also the cleanliness in every corner of the park need to be reviewed, some bad smells in some corners, and toilets also are not clean properly.

Then if you want to see the fireworks, you should buy some snacks and then go to find your places to wait. Beware that it is so crowed that you have to wait and wait and wait.And, one more thing you must make sure you don't mind, there are too many visitors from Mainland China, their behaviors, sometimes, are examining your patience and tolerance level.If you can go to other Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland is absolutely not your first choice to visit.",Disneyland_HongKong,139

Some of the rides are for children, some of them are for families and the other remainder are with a lot of thrill .

We used to have a siesta about 2.30 and go back to our hotel for a chill so boys could have a rest. You must see fireworks. All rides were great, long queues at times but soon went down.

Unfortunately the weather wasn't playing so there were limited rides open, however we were told this before we paid our admission. Great photo opportunities and not too crowded during our visit ( possibly owing to the weather). The gift shops were reasonably priced and had lots of choice, the food choices were poor and some food kiosks only took cash, but didn't tell you this until you were trying to pay.

Many rides were closed for remodeling (Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean   which in themselves are the whole point of going to Disneyland). Paying full fares to stand around in never ending lines in the cold was hard on the children. Disneyworld Florida is crowded as well but offers many more ride options.

Only ate snacks in the park which were expensive. The parade is a must see.

We really felt, though, after this trip that we probably won't go back again. They have raised the prices so much and, even with the fast passes on some rides, we stood in line so long that our kids were tired from all the standing around.

Rides can be busy and wait time is depending on the time of day but a good tip is to go for food or your favourite rides when the parades shows are as they are a must see and very popular so people flock to see them.

I had to change trains at Central Station but there are pink Disneyland signs everwhere directing you to the correct train. To know which train lines and which stations to use refer to a MTR map which comes with the free Hong Kong maps you get at hotels and information booths. I went on a Tuesday and there were no crowds at all so I went on many rides. I enjoyed Toy Story Land the most where all the Toy Story characters were represented.

We visited the Disneyland Park first, used our fast pass at  Peter's Pan Flight , took some rides and left the park. When we came back to the park again as per our fast pass timings, we were informed that the ride is closed and we can use this fast pass at Indiana Jones. What? This really pissed us off.

There was not even single Mickey mouse or Cinderella or any Odr characters. And going to Disneyland studio was total failure. It was just not worth a visit a boring place to be.

We were in line for the Matterhorn when it broke down. The Ride attendant gave us a universal fast pass for 6 people for any ride in Disneyland or California Adventure.",Disneyland_California,124

It took us a while to get our bearings but once we did we managed to do all the rides and shows that we wanted to. If you want to see the parade make sure you get there early say an hour before, its definitely worth it and the same for the firework show at the end of the night.I can honestly say if you are struggling to make your mind up whether to go then take the plunge and book it now you won't be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris,121

This is an amusement for kids of all ages, young and old, people of varied heights and thrill levels. There is something for everyone... rides, food, games, shows, parades, fireworks, etc. Dubbed the  Happiest Place on Earth,  visitors can visit and meet greet Mickey and friends, all the various Disney Characters, Princesses, etc. etc. in their element, story lands as well as other various lands past, present, and future. If you must chose only one amusement park in the area, this would be my park of choice. Amazing imagination and production to make it all happen. Truly magical!

Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons.

Tried to pick off season, disappointed at the massive amount of people (with strollers everywhere) long lines, 60 minute plus wait times, most popular rides were closed for repairs, disappointing and were hoping for a real Disney experience for our kids first time, failed miserably. Food court prices ridiculous, would think with the high cost of admission, you wouldn't need to make a fortune on food also. Restrooms dirty, but the grounds were fairly clean considering the mass amount of people who can't clean up after themselves...Doubt the kids will want to return, they didn't even talk about it much, so sad..",Disneyland_California,121

Being in the senior age range the only rides we went on were the train rides around the park! There was a long queue for the paddle steamer so we didn't wait around for that, but it would have been nice. The food was mostly take away style: burgers, chips and Coke but considering that the park is sponsored by Coca Cola ..... The ice cream parlour was worth the visit   ice cream to die for!

There is clearly a management issues because if employees are openly rude to guests at both rides and eateries, it means that either management doesn't care or they are modeling the behavior of their managers. Either way, it's inexcusable.The park was dirty, again, not the Disneyland standard.The three star rating is only because of the characters who in the July heat stilll engag and enthralled the children that lined up to meet them.

For the high price of admission, the park isn't up to standards meaning it's small compared to the others. Combined with overcrowding, long lines for the kids rides and lack of shade in the sweltering heat here equals no fun and probably the main reason they are losing money. Charging the same entrance fee as other Disneylands double the size with twice as much to do also makes no sense.

So much to do and see and great to revisit with the children after 12 years. The rides the children remembered were too short now for their age group but we all loved the Ratatouille ride in the Disney Studios. Before you could bump into characters rather than the organised times and long queues. I think it would be better to do over two days really. The parades were fantastic and the fireworks and display over the castle breathtaking. It's very expensive to eat and drink about 50    each but we had no choice. The Rock n Roll roller coaster was fantastic   would go again just need to save up!,Disneyland_Paris,129

Definitely something for younger kids but my husband and I also enjoyed it. I really couldn't fault it!! The firework display at the end of the night was a lovely end and although we thought it would be chaos leaving on the train is wasn't at all. Being the number of people leaving at this time we assumed it would take ages to get a train out but we jumped on a train straight away and off we went. Very well organised and the detail was amazing even down to the train that had Mickey mouse windows!!! Loved it!,Disneyland_HongKong,135

Also, there was a lot of construction, with the castle and several other areas cordoned off. I estimate 10% of the park was closed, so not happy to be charged full price, added to the early closing of stalls and shows. Not to Disney standards. But otherwise great atmosphere, and running smoothly. I noticed that some of the electrics on the light parade were not working, so the park could use some maintenance.

Yes, it was overcrowded and hot but we had a blast and did everything we wanted without much waiting. There is a lot of walking. You do need to be in pretty good shape and make certain you drink a lot of water. Give yourself time and you will find all sorts of magical experiences. Our kids 11, 13 and 16 were the perfect ages.

The lines for all popular rides were all 110 minutes. By the end of the day, we had done 2 rides. Not a great return on investment. On peak days like today, they should advise you that lines are extremely long and you may at best get to go to two rides. Even the tame dumbo ride was 75 minutes.

The fireworks at the end of the night in Disneyland park is one of the best and they even had snowfall :) totally loved this place.The rides were great and we got fast passes for a few of them so we wouldn't have to wait in line for to long.

It was a disappointment to me that there are not as many shows as there were in Port Aventura. But then I started to enjoy myself in the atmosphere with music, parades etc. I found Buzz Lighter fun, Pirates of the Caribbean, Autopia ... The rides were accessible on the Wednesday and Thursday before Easter but it started getting worse on Good Friday and especially the day before Easter. The queues were very long and there were people everywhere. I cannot imagine what it would be like in summer. However, in spite of the crowds and all the waiting it is still worth visiting.

The parades are all as one would expect, the hotels are good and the junk food on the park is same as everywhere just more expensive.Try for the best of the hotels you can afford as you seem to get more characters turning up in the more expensive accommodation. Bt of you don't want to push the budget too far just book a character breakfast and you will get lots of photos with the characters.

Brought Dollar Store ponchos in our pockets for the first time and they worked great on Splash Mt. We stayed dry in seats 3, 4, 5 & 6.

The parade is manic, beware of elbows ! People are ruthless to take a photo don't believe in queuing like us British!! Fast pass really good, Magic Kingdom not as good as I thought, my granddaughter loved it though. Everything very expensive, but again to be expected.

For 1 park day we found it to better than the park hopper since there is a lot to cover in each of the parks. We stayed at a hotel outside the parks but near a Disney parking lot, which is free to hop on the shuttles that take you straight to the entrance.

There is also a show 4 or 5 times a day in the same area that alternates with Rapunzel and Snow White. Seating is limited and it is full by 15 30 minutes prior to showtime. A benefit of seating at the show? You get to meet the princess afterwards. Location is right by Sleeping Beauty's Castle.

The lines to meet certain characters are ridiculous, but totally worth it. Oh and going during the week helps BIG TIME! The most I wait while at the park was twenty five minutes.

We enjoyed the revised Star Tours but did not like the Halloween themed Space Mountain or the Haunted Mansion. It seemed many of the rides kept breaking down while we were there (i.e. Space Mountain, Matterhorn).

Toon Town is definitely better at D land. Kids all had a blast. We had a range of ages (4yrs to 60yrs) so we split up sometimes and then everyone got to focus on what they liked best.

Parents of young riders should be aware that the Haunted Mansion and Big Thunder Mountain rides have a lot of time in the dark compared to WDW. The parks are a little smaller than WDW and easier to navigate.I guess we are spoiled by the cleanliness of WDW as we were a little disappointed to find litter and weeds in the landscaping and on the walkways from the Disney hotels to the Disney Village.

The parades are amazing and so is the fireworks. The photos with the characters are sure to cheer up kids and also adults. The lion king show and the 3d movie is quite well done and entertaining. You would need more than one day to enjoy the park. If you can then book at one of the hotels in disneyland for a night and make use of their 2 day pass. would feel a bit expensive but is absolutely worth it.

We do go but we can go for a couple hours and leave if we get overwhelmed by the crowds. If you can only go during summer try to early in summer before in gets too hot and most schools are out and not on the weekends. Use the fast pass system it helps use your time wisely!

If you aren't bothered about going on the rides with your friends partner then get a single rider ticket. Food wasn't overpriced. You can take water into the park and there are plenty of water fountains to fill up at. Parades were excellent however we didn't get to see the fireworks as there was a technical problem.

241269618,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Park is a beautiful place to visit, with or without children. My tips are to walk through mainstreet towards the castle, but open your eyes to look at the way it has all been put together. Sometimes it's easy to wiz through to rides but by doing this you are missing out on the atmosphere that the themed lands etc bring. If you are visiting for a few days, try to leave the busy rides until the evening when ques are usually shorter and sometimes allow multiple rides. If you can visit at christmas as this is when it's at its very best. I recommend Pirates of the Caribbean as a must (maybe I'm bias but it is my favourite).

The rides that were open were kind of tatty (can't believe I'm saying that about Disney) but a lot of the rides could have done with a lick of paint.The main problem though, the prices,    7 for two cans of soft drink   never again.I'd save and go to wdw instead!!",Disneyland_Paris,136

HK Disney is a magical experience in and of itself. Since the last time I was here three years ago, the park has more than doubled in size. Toy story land is open and wonderful. Construction remains ongoing and Grizzly Gluch is open, though it leaves a lot to be desired. Food in this park, at least at the Mei Sum hosted restaurant, blows Florida Disney food out of the water! Definitely the park can be done in a day, provided that it is not a public holiday or weekend, even with kids in tow. I'd advise that you go on a weekday as we were able to do all desired rides and some ride 2 3 times.",Disneyland_HongKong,140

We never waited more than 30 minutes for any ride, but we took advantage of the fast pass for the more popular rides and didn't get a chance to get on the Finding Nemo Sub Voyage. You manage to ride on Star Tours, Matterhorn, and Hyper Space Mountain multiples times using fast pass without waiting more than 20 minutes. I can't stress enough how important it is to take advantage of the fast pass and use it strategically. If not planned Riley could be waiting between 1   2 hours to ride on some of the more popular rides. We stayed off site at the Spring Hill suites Anaheim convention center. Short 10   15 minute walk that was very easy even for a five year old. ",Disneyland_California,133

Make sure to get a schedule of parades and shows either at the gate or your motel. Arrive at least 1 2 hour early for the show. Especially the parades! There is hardly room to stand.

We were glad to see that the train and Steamboat were operating again. They have improved the looks of the area where the train passes through the old ranch are. It is landscaped beautifully. You can even view the construction of the new Star Wars Land from the train. The new Maxpass process is well worth the money. It saves time and frustration.

There are two parks co located    the Disneyland park and the Disney Studio park. I visited both and found them very exciting. Some rides require the child to be 4 years and above, but I was able to take my 3 year old daughter to most of them. The studio theme park has a guided bus tour which demonstrates the working of a set used to create an explosive movie stunt (videos on youtube). There are some roller coaster rides that smaller children can enjoy too. The queues tend to be long across all popular rides.

There were some things that were overprices, mostly food, but in general, it was not as expensive as I was expecting it to be. I would suggest one park per day passes though.

The kids loved it all including the special Disney train and station.

Cinderella's castle is much smaller, which goes to show the differences between the year the parks were created. When this park was built, Cinderella's Castle would have been considered grand.

The park rides are still great fun and the park is maintain in the usual Disney way, but the staff just lack that little edge of Disney magic that makes you truly feel you are a kid again. Most theme parks take advantage of the captive market and exploit the customer by hiking up the prices of everything, and this is no exception. It can still be a fun day out and we did have a great laugh, but the experience just isn't quite the same with a French accent. ",Disneyland_Paris,123
153134554,4,2012-6,United States,I would have to say that my experience at Disneyland has been a great one overall because the rides in my opinion are better than the ones at Disneyworld. Still I have to say that overall I like Disneyworld better. Also I am not trying to scare anybody from going to Disneyland because I think it's a good place to check out when you're in the LA area. But I will say that you need to be aware of your surroundings and the people around you because Disneyland does have kind of a rough crowd. And why I'm bringing this up is because two people tried to steal my sister's purse when we were there. So just be careful and have fun.,Disneyland_California,122

You must stay for the Disney Dreams closing show, it was very impressive.The queues were short on most rides while we were there from the 9th to 13th March, most of them we just walked on or used our hotel fastpass tickets.The only negative was the amount of rides closed for refurbishment with Frontier land having only Big Thunder Mountain running, everything else in the land was closed. You can check the Disney website for a list of closures, but not everything closed was listed.But that's enough of the downsides, the positives still outweigh them, it really was a magical experience, and I am still smiling despite being back home in the rain...",Disneyland_Paris,131

It is just right for my young family as it is not too sprawling but also big enough that we can easily spend at least 3 days and up to a week there. I have 2 young daughters aged 7 and 3 and there was something for everyone in the family. Our family's favourites are:It's a small worldFinding NemoIndiana JonesHyperspace Mountain (though I still prefer the original Space Mountain)Paint the Night paradeMickey and the Magical MapThe fact that the California Adventure Park is just a short walk across the gates is also a big bonus.,Disneyland_California,125

Until last December when I saved the money and went with my boyfriend as a 19 year old.To say Disneyland Park exceeded my expectations was an understatement  it's really something your just can't even imagine unless you're there regardless of how much planning and research you do  and believe me I did tonnes!To try put it into perspective I got so emotional when I walked into the park I cried, on Peter Pan's Flight I cried, watching Dreams I cried  it's just such a magical place no matter what age you are.If you're thinking about going  JUST GO!

The same stuff with even smaller scale. The most disturbing thing is that the queue is outrageous for the main rides. And the recently opened area's ride had broke down multiple times.Still if you are first time being at Dinseyland, then you may enjoy it. There is some exclusive for this park like the Toy Story Land, the Iron Man thingy(which is not open yet)etc.Getting there is easy as well, just get to any MTR station and buy a ticket and you will be there in no time.

Each day before 1000 there was very few people about and worst of all a very limited number of areas open which included the rides for getting fast passes where applicable. I felt sorry especially for the 'little ones'. The other dissapointment was at the 2300 Thursday Light Show there was no sound for about 75% of the performance on our side of the park and limited sound on the other side. As spectacuar as it was, the sound was barely audible which took the shine off the whole event that night. As for the rest, beyond 1000 start time the parks were all open, the queues were long, the weather was fantastic, the rides were brilliant and a great time was had by all.",Disneyland_Paris,140

We arrived as the park opened and were able to get most of the larger rides done by noon, then spent the rest of our time at the park checking out the smaller rides, shows and shopping. Very clean facility, and the staff was very friendly (from security all the way thru the different parts of the park). Looking forward to going back again. ",Disneyland_California,121

No carrying bags around all day) The food was as we expected, the park was very clean and the lines were very well managed considering we went at the start of USA school holidays.

And you can get to California early by going through the California Hotel and that drops you right near where you can get your night time show tickets. The only slow part of visiting Disneyland is having to have bags, purses, strollers, etc., checked. I wish there was a line for entering the park without anything but the clothes on your back. It would allow others to enter without having to wait in line for items to be checked. As always staff is friendly and very helpful and knowledgeable about the park.

The crowds increased each successive day as the temperature rose. By friday it was packed! Almost impossible to move in some areas like tomorrow land and Adventureland.

There are plenty of affordable child freindly attractions there e.g. Bois de bologne, jardin luxembourg, the Paris aquarium...... If you are smart you can also eat well at reasonable cost too.

Disneyland is the real thing; an American theme park in the USA and that's a big part of what makes it so much fun. The cast members were polite and helpful, there were actors in character wandering about and, although expensive, what you get is almost worth it. Lot's of very long queues allowed me to watch the Americans, which was most amusing.On the negative side, Disney is a rapacious business and that showed pretty clearly in their attempts to flog expensive tat and manipulate you to buy overpriced, very unhealthy snacks.

So if you have just one day, forget the park hopper pass and just choose one park and enjoy of what it has to offer.

As with Disney World in Florida, the only downside to these parks are all the strollers and motorized carts that are in use. The walking areas were just not designed for that traffic. The strollers are really bothersome at times. People bring their own double side strollers and some almost use them as a battering ram to get through the crowd.

Because of China's one child policy, the ratio of adults to children is also higher at this park than the parks in California or Florida.

Thankfully, I had been forewarned not to compare it to the U.S. Disney parks. The 2 parks in Paris are very small compare to Disneyland, California, which is small compared to Disney World. Also many of the rides were down for refurbishment but I knew that ahead of time because I checked the Disney website. I have learned in my many years of doing Disney parks that you really need to do your research if you want to have a successful trip. We visited on a Friday and while there were crowds, we did not wait more than 30 minutes for anything. The parks are cute, glad I went since I was in the neighborhood, but I would not go again.",Disneyland_Paris,140

If there is 3 persons waiting to get some food in a fast food restaurant you have to wait 30 minutes because service is so terrible slow.French cashiers are not interested in fast service and cash register machine seems always a strange thing to them. Seems like ike they are doing their job for the first day. Sometimes it seems terrible difficult to get your items paid. 2 eployees were fast and effective and they were from Estonia and Sweden.

In Frontierland one staff member said (when there was a complete blockage) to leave by train. The train conductor said the train wasn't running.

I arrived at 9am, with the park opening at 10am. I stayed until 7pm, visiting both the park and Disney Studios next door. One HUGE recommendation, especially if traveling alone: go later in the day. By 5pm, most of the kids in the park were exhausted and the parks began to be a lot less crowded. I went on several rides, including several roller coasters, without any wait in line.

II would say that there wasn't very much advertising for the events that were happening in the park. I think also that the fireworks are far to late. We had a two hour drive home so to have to wait around until 22.00 to see the fireworks then was too late. Also alot of the rides shut at 17.00 so you have along period to wait with nothing to do.I was also very dissapointed that the characters weren't around to have photos with.

It was a little expensive, but worth every penny to see the look on her face when her  fairy godmother  competed the transformation, complete with pixie dust! I totally recommend buying a PhotoPass Plus before you arrive at the park, we got over 900 pictures of our family of three in our 4 days.

It's worth getting there early for a good seat for both. The queues are awful though. I can't imagine what they are like in the summer holidays. Must be horrific. The food is ridiculously priced and we always took our own. And the smoking in the park is vile. Why aren't there smoking areas?

Highlights were the very expensive but fun princess lunch at the auberge du cendrillon, finding no queues at Pirates of the Caribbean so going round three times, and the buzz lightyear ride. Our tips are to arrive as early as poss as all rides less busy then, and eat lunch early ie twelve, to avoid queues. Also maybe don't plan too much, this is not received wisdom, but it's hard to predict where the crowds will be, so be prepared to just go for which has the least queue and enjoy what you can without spending all day queuing.

Not a good view of the film, and the action slammed you into the wall of the ride vehicle. They need to take out the seats next to the walls. It was a very rough pounding on the shoulders.

It is key to utilise the fastpass system to get the most from the park. It's free and helps you organise the day, however you can only print 1 at a time so use them wisely Big advice is to do the studios during magic time as not that much is open in the main park till 10.

Buffet is really expensive, but worth the price for its spectacular extensive menu and dessert. Heaven for the sweet tooth.

The Golden Mickey show was great. The Lion King shows was good. Different than Animal Kindgom show. Lines were not too bad. Typically long was at the car and jungle cruise. Taking mass transit there was very easy. I would agree with many of the reviews that the magic you feel in Orlando isn't the same.

It is aggravating to know that you paid about the same price for a three day pass as the locals paid for a one year pass. Disney needs to increase the annual pass cost to decrease crowd sizes by about 30%. It's just not fair, and it's just not fun with that many people.

However due to the huge lines, we were very limited to the number of rides we could take. Space Mountain and California Scream roller coaster were great. Don't waste your time on The Matterhorn, it is so jerky that it is actually painful. Nemos submarine ride is a dud. The Mr. Lincoln attraction is interesting, but parts of it are very dated.

Riding the Matterhorn and the Indiana Jones rides are just a couple of examples of great experiences you won't find in DW.",Disneyland_California,124

All the other reviews have said all that needs to be said to be honest however whilst we didn't find the food as expensive as we had been lead to believe, we found the cost of the merchandise to be unnecessarily high. If anyone from Disneyland ever reads these reviews, please consider addressing this issue. If the prices are cheaper you will probably sell more and not have parents wincing everytime their kid spends their hard earnt pocket money on something so overpriced you want to cry! This is my only gripe though, we have returned with some great memories at our time here and California Adventure Park next door.",Disneyland_California,132
600278676,4,2018-7,United States,"I love Disneyworld, been there 4 times, so I was apprehensive about a smaller park and visiting Disneyland in July! No problem, this park can handle crowds well!The stores, eateries and some rides were easily accessible in Disneyland and Disney California. Sure there were some long lines, but overall it was still a fun, happy place...for kids as well as adults!I would have given this park 5 stars, yet found that the Disney costume characters found around the park were sparse or didn   t have time for the kids ( they seemed in a rush to get somewhere else). I didn   t find this Disney character shortage at Disneyworld, unless they   ve changed characters visits too.All in all, Disney is a first rate park whether in California or Florida. Hope to visit again soon!",Disneyland_California,134

Attractions for kids and adults, lots of shops to buy anything Disney and a good selection of places to eat. I never get tired of Disneyland.A bit expencive, but I guess you can't expect it very cheap with this kind of merchandise...One advise though: try avoiding the high season. Much better to come in the spring or fall (I think May or September are good months) as the temperatures are better and you don't have to wait so long for each attraction.And make sure to set off at least two whole days to cover everything. ; )",Disneyland_Paris,123

Westerners I suggest packing a lunch, it took us hours to find fish and chips instead of eating rice with chicken and other asian dishes. Stay away from the 'hotdogs', the thought of them now makes me queezy!Brace yourself, the people don't appear to care at all for lines, it does get infuriating. Bottom line: park is the perfect size for young families, there's not really any 'big kids' rides like other Disney parks. But if you don't care for rides and have a spare day, go for a look, stay for the fireworkssss!!!",Disneyland_HongKong,122

However, the food and drinks were expensive (at least HK$ 92 for chicken with rice fries good for one person; HK$26 for a can of coke or bottled water). In Mongkok, a bigger sized bottled water cost only HK$10, while a can of coke cost only HK$7). My kids, aged 11 and 5, had a blast though and that is all that really matters. You just can't put a price to their happiness. Don't forget to check out the Toy Story Land, Lilo and Stitch Interactive show and the Magic something (3D) show.

Take fast passes as much as you can to reduce the waiting lines. Few people are doing them so this could be an extra plus. Eating in the Village is very expensive but less waiting lines than in both parks. Eating after 14h or before noon could help as well. Attractions are possible to do untill half an hour of closing time. Great gathering on main road for Disney dreams. Stick till the end cause it's wonderful. Afterwards, don't take the main road to the exit but one of the two galleries next to it. ",Disneyland_Paris,134
585085151,5,2018-5,United States,Well I did what I said I would never do and this visit Disneyland on a weekend..holiday weekend at that. I can can say it is worth getting the MaxPass to be able to do the FastPass right on your phone. We were able to ride all the attractions we wanted with minimal wait time. Even for the rides we had to wait the lines went fast. It has been a while since I have been here and like that we can bring in a soft cooler and pack snacks and drinks for the drinks. Cost can be an issue since it's not cheap to get in but being able to bring in food is a cost savings :) I will definetely be back,Disneyland_California,124

My most recent visit was to celebrate my mom's 86th birthday (and her 1st visit). They made her feel like a Queen! We went to the Town Hall to find out about wheelchair access (we rented one for $12 day) since taking on the whole park by foot at age 86 would have been a bit too challenging for her. They were wonderfully helpful with tips for getting the most from our visit . She was given a 1st timers badge AND a Happy Birthday badge to wear for the day. Disneyland staff and park visitors alike were wishing her a happy birthday by name all day long and she loved it.,Disneyland_California,139

Just before we were leaving, I realized I didn't have the hoodie. One of the clerks went to get a manager, who looked to see if anyone had turned it in. No luck. She asked if I had the receipt. No, it was in the bag. But I had paid for it by credit card. She asked if I knew what time I had bought it, and I knew it was after 10:15 and before 10:30.

Congratulations to them, just wish we knew better to plan smarter.

I've also been to Disney in Orlando and also Universal Studios and I remember those as being fun even if I went there when I was already 27. But this Disney is smaller and the rides are less   scary and thrilling. It really is a wonderland for kids. My 12 year old niece enjoyed it but me, not as much. Also, when you watch the festival of lights, if ou can't go near from the center, better to be at the center even if you are far away. That way, you can still see the fireworks. We decided to go near but at the side and was only able to see once part of the castle, the other part was blocked from view.",Disneyland_HongKong,129

Definitely use the fast passes and be aware that they are usually all used by 12pm. We found that after 5pm some rides at the back of the park such as Pirates of the Caribbean and it's a small world we empty but other rides had a 1.5 hour queue. The studio park has a unique feature of single rider, make use of this as the line is a lot shorter and sometimes you even ride with people with you. It is a long day especially if you stay for the fireworks, as it doesn't get dark until 10.30pm in summer. Easy to get to on public transport.",Disneyland_Paris,131

The stores are WAY OVERPRICED and very small   could not believe how tiny the World of Disney was! Very limited sizes in merchandise. And they were out of buttons! You know, the buttons you get to celebrate a birthday, or first visit, etc. That was one of the 2 main souveneirs I wanted from France   that and a Disneyland Paris sweatshirt.

We did indulge in a few churros and mickey mouse ice cream bars.The lines for rides were between 20 and 65 minutes depending on the ride. A word of warning, the peter pan ride was always long.

We stayed in Los Angeles at the Magic Castle Hotel (BEST HOTEL EVER!), and it was about a 30 minute drive to Disney.Tips:You can do both parks in one day. Do Disney California Adventure first! The very first thing you need to do is get a Fast Pass for Radiator Springs Racers. These  sell  out very quickly and was the best ride of the both parks. :)Flo's V 8 Cafe has yummy sandwiches that are reasonably priced for kids.

With so many options of rides, shows and things to do, there's something for everyone. But do be prepared to do a lot of walking. And I do mean a lot. It's all concrete and asphalt so good supportive shoes is a must if you spend more than a day. Do your research ahead of time and find some package deals.

It was a sunny Friday in October so it was surprising to see it so empty. Very few lines   the longest wait was 20 minutes for lunch. I liked the roller coasters but my tall husband (6'4 ) did not because they are designed for short people   prepare for an uncomfortable ride if you're over 6'. Also, most of the street cart vendors were closed and there weren't many characters walking around, so not quite as  magical  as Disneyland California but definitely worth a visit.

The parade at 5.30 looked ok but people filed to watch it from before 5 so we didnt see much.My younger ine was disappointed that frozen was nowhere to be seen, neither activities related to her (notwithstanding that frozen merchandise was everywhere).

Well, done Disney!A few caveats: This is Asia, so while you will find mostly  normal  food (and everything will be high quality) you still have to deal with line cutters (Cast Members are usually helpful with this), odd combinations (chicken and prawn anyone) and umbrellas in your face during the parade.

Maxim   s has a restaurant here for a good grub before heading home.The Mickey Mouse waffles on Main Street was great.The meet and greet were very popular but maddening as the queues snaked out of view.Electric parade was not too impressive.Fireworks and light and sound show was lovely.Shops were nicely laid out and not too overwhelming, thankfully.",Disneyland_HongKong,138

They staff are always smiling and are very happy.

Simple tip stay in a Disney hotel, the magic hours between 8 and 10 in the morning is essential. In these two hours you will manage to do most rides and the queue for a character is 10 minutes instead of an hour. You will achieve more in these 2 hours than entering the park at the normal time and staying all day.

The only thing that was terrible was that there were absolutely no options for vegetarian food. Absolutely none except some corn. Now, if you   ve set up a world famous theme park, people from all over the world are going to come. There would be so many who may look for veg food. It   s not a localized theme park which will be visited by locals only. And in this part if the world visitors from India will be so many. Needs so more thought on that one !!

Eating at park restaurants can be pricey but worth it for just my wife and I, as no grandchildren on this trip this time. The fireworks as usual are the best I have seen.

We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel so having early entry really did help we got on so much in the first 3hrs, so if you can stretch your budget stay on site it really is worth every cent and adds to the magic of your holiday.

This being our families first visit to Disneyland after many previous trips to Disneyworld we had two major complaints. We choose to stay at a Disney resort in part to get the magic hours. We were very disappointed to find out upon arrival that only fantasy land and tomorrowland rides were open during magic hours. That combined with not being able to get fastpasses during magic hour made it not really worth it. The other complaint is how many rides were closed while we were there. Indiana Jones, small world, ariel's grotto, nemo, and alice were all closed. My wife is one of those small world nuts so she was very disappointed and we were all disappointed by Indiana Jones being closed.",Disneyland_California,132

We bought out tickets at the hotel making entry very easy. As grandparents we were very impressed with the $100HK entry for us (a substantial concession). Adults are $399HK. We caught a taxi to and from TST and could not believe the efficiency at the end of a very long day when we walked straight up to a taxi and were whisked away immediately   no queues. We were lucky to experience the magic of Disney at Christmas time and the park was decorated beautifully.

We waited for 2 hours to go to splash mountain only to be told it was closed for  technical reasons . To pay $100 US each for the day we feel like it was a rip off. The next day we went to Disney California which was marginally better. Apparently we were not there during the busy season, but refuse to wait 1 hour 15 minutes on a queue. At least at Disney California they provide shade mostly while waiting. ",Disneyland_California,132

They don't have as many fast pass opportunities nor do they have many single rider lines. So the lines are incredibly long. I missed having a separate theater for Fantasmic (although the Disneyland show was better) and World of Color would have been nicer to see if I actually could have seen the whole thing. We had fast passes for it and got there close to the earliest time to line up (almost an hour before it started) and we still were so far behind people we couldn't see the whole thing.

If you are going, one day should be enough especially if visiting on a weekday. Make sure you eat heavy before going and be there as the park opens at 10am. The park closes after the fireworks display at 8pm. Expect that food inside the park is very expensive but good thing, you can bring in your own water, there are drinking fountains everywhere.

I will say after having been to every Disney park short of China spanning the last 30 years this trip showed some flaws in the magical experience. A number of rides had some glitches. Bathrooms were not very clean. Max pass app broke one day (but after an hour a cast member set up a fix and IT had it running by midday). Early park entry is good and bad: a number of rides were not open in Disneyland park and Adventure park none were (see adventure park review). Food was expensive and salty but to be expected.

As usual the food and drinks are ridiculously priced and in most of the park's food places it's cash only. The day we went the average wait time was about 30 minutes and the weather was perfect.

Food prices were no different to any theme park around the world. Getting to the park was very easy and you could easily travel from Paris each day if you really wanted as the train station is literally at the front gate and only takes about 1 hour or so from Gare Lyon.The park was everything we had imagined and hoped for so definitely worth the visit if you are in Paris.,Disneyland_Paris,124

It is like Disneyland in Anaheim, but with that jungle feeling, since it is in the middle of Lantau Island. Cheaper than US Disneys. The only negative side to it, it's that there are no memorable souveniers to bring back. We thought that there were going to be a lot of Chinese themed souveniers, but there weren't.

We queued for over half an hour for the haunted house to get to the front & be told there were technical difficulties & to come back later   felt we wasted a lot of time & didn't get much back. As so many rides were down the ones that were running had large wait times. The park also closed earlier @ 8 on the day we went due to the halloween special.

We stayed in the Disneyland Hotel and the location of the hotel is simply the best with easy access to the park in the mornings and easy to pop back to get things during the day. Breakfast in the hotel at Inventions was very good and their were characters outside the breakfast room each day with a photographer.

There are so many classic attractions that the other Disney parks don't have anymore (Snow White, Mr. Toad, etc.). Where to begin? Probably with anice walk down Main Street, right through the castle, and into Fantasyland. Try and do this in the early morning or late at night. Then you can go left or right and make a big cricle around the park. My favorite spot is in New Orleans Square. Two wonderful attractions reside here, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion. Don't miss them. There are plenty of places to eat, and buy souvenirs.

It seemed to be very crowded due to graduation nights and the soft opening of Cars Land at California Adventure. My family still had a great time but prefer going in February or October. It also seems people are getting ruder and overheard a couple of families stating they lied about getting a pass saying thier family memebers were handicap so they wouldn't have to wait in line.

The queues for the rides and the characters were around 45 minutes unless you did the fast pass. It zapped out the fun and excitement for the kids too.

In November Small World is all decked out for Christmas with the dolls singing Jingle Bells instead of the usually song.

Very easily accessible by the RER Train (drop off at the last station   Chessy) and you will find the park once you exit the Metro station. There isnt a need to prior purchase the tickets. I went on a Sunday and the ticket counter was efficient and not too crowded either. We managed to get our tickets within 5 minutes. No worries about the food being costly inside the park.

I would really advise this place only for families with young children. In 2003, there were Disney characters and staff wondering around the park engaging with guests.

Wait time was approx. 45   60 minutes for a 2 minute ride. I was called sir by an employee who didn't even bother to correct himself or apologize. Worst experience would rather spend $192 I wasted at another park.",Disneyland_California,128

It's great to meet the characters and we didn't wait more than 15mins unless it was for Mickey & Minnie. It was great to see the park all dressed up for Halloween and Day of the Dawn. Great fun!Food was quiet reasonable, as are drinks. Quick entry after security too. Only disappointment was the shops. I saw a few things through the day I liked that I hope would be sold in the shops by the exit and they weren't there so didn't get a chance to buy anything in the end.Great day out   really recommend for big and small kids!",Disneyland_Paris,132

We had a wonderful day and the park was not too busy at this time of the year which made it a pleasure as the queues were not long and the wait for rides went very quickly. There is such a wonderful atmosphere in the park and everyone was very friendly and considerate. The only downside was the lunches. Very bland food on offer, however, the waffles were outstanding. The outside eating area also needs to be sorted as there are too many birds bugging you when you are trying to eat. All in all a great day out and a wonderful fun day for kids and parents alike.",Disneyland_HongKong,131

Long waits to enter sets a bad tone for the day in  February, which has fewer visitors than other months.The happiest place on earth, has cast members yelling at a 2 year old pulling on the rope that he is holding to end the line to visit Buzz. What does one expect from a two year old who is waiting in yet another line.A very nasty cast member in city hall refused to discussed disability access when asked questions based on written material that disney publishes on their website.So much for the happiest place on earth.",Disneyland_California,122

Fantasyland looks like it hasn't changed since the place opened and Tomorrowland is more like  what tomorrow looked like 40 years ago  (although the Star Wars attractions bring it up to the 90s). Disney does a much better job of giving you stuff to do while you stand in line for the attractions, but there aren't many thrills to be had here. My 6 y.o.  loved it all , but I doubt we'll ever make it back   he loves thrill rides just as much as he did the not so thrilling attractions at Disney, and I can get a season pass to my local amusement park for what 1 day at Disney costs (even after the 3 day pass discount).",Disneyland_California,135

I was impressed at the healthy food options on offer   the baked potatoes (by the haunted house) were the best value for money for lunch and really filling.

I loved that, since it is a smaller park than the one in Florida, they really pay attention to detail and the Halloween decorations were awesome. Even with a park quite full, we didn't have to wait that much in lines. On our holiday we went to several sit down restaurants expecting to spend a lot, and actually, prices were quite reasonable for the service and quality of dishes.

245068342,3,2014-12,United Kingdom,We visited December 2014 with our son and his family. The park itself didn't disappoint but since our last visit 10 years ago it has become very very expensive particularly the restaurants which have mostly adopted a fixed price menu. For 2 adults and 2 children a meal with drinks costs at least   75 and this is a basic meal. A burger type meal for a family costs about   50. Be prepared for this the park takes advantage of its isolated location and captive market. My tip   stay at Ranch Crockett which has self catering facilities and take as much food with you as you can. Also the garage shop near to the parks car park is much cheaper than the on site shops.,Disneyland_Paris,124

I knew that before we went, but wasn't prepared for just how expensive it was. Loads to do, many shops, many restaurants. Not as many simple healthy meal options as we would have liked. Everyone wants you to buy a predetermined meal with drink. A few things really bothered me   for a childrens theme park, there should be rules about where people can smoke. I kept having to pull my kids out of the way of careless adults walking around smoking. Also, for such a well oiled machine, the bathrooms were very dirty and smelly with very long queues for the ladies.",Disneyland_Paris,128

I   ve come over 5000 miles and paid through the nose to stand in line at rehashed rides and over pay for any food or beverages. This is smaller than Orlando & has limitations due to the availability of real estate nearby. BUT and this is a huge BUT for the money I paid for a one day 2 park hopper & the amount of profit Disney make they need to limit the parks capacity (that   s both parks). Fast pass is a swizz and you need to plan really well if you still insist on getting one. The only redeeming light is the cast members who make the experience bearable. ,Disneyland_California,129

Those familiar with the Disney parks in the U.S. will see much of the same. Moderately long lines and Disney characters walking about. The food choices are primarily European in nature and most of the food joints didn't open until after 11. Other than that you'll find similiar accommodations as the American parks to include strollers, if needed, and rides you're familiar with.

It was my sons bday and most of crew wished him happy birthday. He was truly elated with this gesture. Not to miss is the Jedi training, lion king show and the wondrous book show.

We were able to ride plenty of rides utilizing Ridemax and the fastpsss system, but people that did not do any planning were in huge lines (some at 180 minutes), which did not seem worth it to me.

Then onto Down Town Disney for dinner. Only down side to our day was the ART shuttle Bus system that kept us waiting in the rain in the morning when we waited 40 minutes for the bus that was 20 minutes late in the morning.

I also recommend that you purchase the 2 day pass as then you can see everything you missed out on the first time. Please take lots of money with you of a fully loaded credit card as there is so many opportunity's to purchase souvenirs from the many shops as well as photos from the Characters and rides.

I was surprized how small Cinderella's castle looked compared to WDW. This park is much smaller, but that helps cut down on the walking. I felt this park was very clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. I could be wrong, but I think some of the rides seemed longer than WDW.

(sarcasm) We go to Disney parks several times a year (was in Hong Kong in August and Orlando in January), and never have we seen anything like this. Wait a year, then go, you will have a new park! Or, you can go now and see all the stuff under construction if your into that! Lastly, they really need to replace that RUDE woman at the door of the Mediterranean buffet!",Disneyland_Paris,138

Pump up your adrenalin with those attractions for maximum 5 minutes, you feel young all the time! or you puke! : ))Disneys keeps the cleanliness of all the rest rooms. Consumption for the beverages is affordable, so for tight budget no need to bring drinks from home ; p. Fast foods in studio disney are surprisingly much more delicious than MacD. The merchandising like t' shirts, Jackets are unbelievably have good quality though we know the workers are poorly paid. Yesss... as always a very long queue and a big PATIENCE are absolutely NEEDED!

There is truly something for everyone here and Disney is the best at providing an exceptional family experience.We travelled with our 5 year old and infant this year and split 3 days between the Disneyland park and California adventure using a Park Hopper pass.The rider switch pass allowed both parents to enjoy the park with our older daughter, and our baby was able to enjoy many of he rides with us so that the whole family could stay together.The park is clean, safe, and full of fun & surprises.

You pay a lot for this service, but we literally achieved about 2 days worth of rides in those 6 hours! Our guide in plaid was outstanding and she knew the park inside and out.

344133763,2,2016-1,United States,"We visited Disneyland in January with our eight year old son. My summary of the experience is:  ticket prices are prohibitively expensive, particularly if you have more than one child  the park itself if VERY, VERY crowded. We deliberately chose a  quiet day on a quiet week  and it was still ridiculously crowded. Wait times on rides ranged up to 70 minutes which is just crazy. Clearly the number of annual pass holders clog up the park making it way too busy  the rides themselves are old, old, old and need to be updated  food at the park is poor quality and expensive  if you choose to go, learn the fast pass system before you enter the park as this is somewhat helpfulWe would not recommend a visit to Disneyland.",Disneyland_California,130

We usually do Disneyland or Disney World in the fall, after school starts back up, so although we expected the park to be busy, this was still a bit overwhelming! It was really packed. Still got to see and do everything we wanted to, but that was only because we have been many times, and therefore skipped parts that we knew we didn't care about. We were there for seven hours, and were able to ride Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Haunted Mansion. Even took in a show at the Saloon! However, with the park this busy, there's no way a first timer could do the whole thing in one day.

The longest wait we had for any ride all day was less than 15 minutes. On our visit, Space Mountain was closed for refurbishment, as was Haunted Mansion (presumably getting set for Halloween). However, we still had a blast! We rode Thunder Mountain, Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Indiana Jones twice apiece.

If you can   t have fun there, then you probably are a boring person. If you aren   t a    ride    person there is plenty to see and do. There are multiple tours that talk about Walt and the history behind the park. Ride the train or monorail. See the show in the air conditioned Tiki room. Eat some great food.

We went as two couples in our mid twenties and had a blast. We made the mistake of doing the park hopper and trying to do both parks in one day... I highly discourage that. We were so beat by the early evening. I highly recommend one park a day and taking a mid day break, head to your hotel to soak in the pool and relax in your room for a few hours before heading back.

We been to all of them in the USA and will go back again.This park is certainly more suited to younger people as there is really only a few rides that will give you thrills. We purchased a 2 day ticket and ended up doing what we wanted to do in two half days.Don't miss the fireworks.

If you want posh restaurants book in early, save money by filling bottles at drinking fountains buy snaks from the train station! You can take drinks and snaks into the park just not full on picnics. The shows are stunning especial the fireworks at 22.30, for photos turn up early. Best advise go early to your most wanted rides and attractions book where possible, eat a large breakfast, expect to spend money and finally with young kids under six take a pushchair !",Disneyland_Paris,140

Between the two parks, considering cost ($142 Knott's vs $300  Disney for 3 adults each park) crowds and overall experience i liked Knott's better. Disney is great....but they are quickly forgetting their past while Knott's has spent a lot of time restoring it. Added Disney will always be crowded.....different degrees of crowded......but you better like crowds. I grew up near both parks so maybe I see Disney as greatly changed, not for the better, and that alters my opinion......I still love Disney but I have heard a number near my age talk about the park catering to new fans while dump the old ones.",Disneyland_California,131

Take advantage of the fast passes if you plan on riding lots of rides. You might end up going back and forth across the park, but it is good walking. Eat either before or after the 12:00 hour for less crowds at the restaurants. Stay for the fireworks show... it is well worth your time. Fantasmic is another great show, but you will want to arrive early for better seating.Utilize the train for travel around the park.

Most time you will spend at Fantasyland. Here you have maximum number of rides and shows. Also many characters would visit you. Because you have so many things to cover so plan your route accordingly. As we had 2 day pass, we went around in liesure. Lion king show was mind blowing. So was Mickey and the adventure book. we had a great time. The night parade was amazing. Plan to sit atleast 30 mins ahead of the schedule so that you get the best place to watch any show.

After that, various areas seem pretty similar, the Wild West, Africa and so on. Toilet facilities did not seem so frequent as in the 'Studio' area, or as well sign posted. I think the reason for that, as well, is by the second day, you are tired from the previous day, and a bit jaded. Saying that, the 'Star Wars' ride was amazing and 'Buzz Lightyear. The 'fast track' system works well, which enables the visitor to return to the chosen ride in a 30 minute slot. ",Disneyland_Paris,131

Should have the characters walking around all day like they do in Florida not just for certain times in the days. 2 hour queue to see princess, 45   120 for other rides.

Save the rides where lines move fast, like Pirates and Haunted Mansion for later. Bring a bag with water or snacks for little ones   prices in the park are a little crazy. You can find a list of all of the places in the park that have hidden Mickeys   it makes for a fun search and find game.

This time the park was much slower and we literally walked to the front of the line on several major rides.We are lucky enough to have a Club 33 connection so we eat there.

At the food area, we placed a specific order and what we got instead was totally different. on pointing out, the staff member reluctantly agreed to change and to our shock again gave us something totally different from what we ordered.

The problem is not so much about the park but the people in it. You will find that about 45%   (sometimes about 70%) of people there at any given time are from mainland China. They truly 'bring' their 'culture' with them   spitting anywhere, smoking outside the smoking area (can't read, perhaps?), speaking loudly, queue barging, etc....

When you are inside, get the map try get on the toys which are recommended to see. After that if you have time try others. Some of them was in maintenance and closed in May 2015.I recommend you to prepare sandviches at home and put them in your bag, because the prices in the stores are very high. You can eat them in the long lines while waiting for your turn.Be there in the morning because area is very big and time is not enough for all of the toys. Also toilettes were very clean.Have fun!",Disneyland_Paris,127
275509680,4,2015-5,United States,"We had a great day at Disneyland but it felt extremely crowded in the afternoon and evening. There were several fun rides but it honestly feels like many of them are getting older and due for some new or redone rides with a fresher feel. For the rides alone, I would definitely prefer California Adventure over Disneyland, but the parade, shows, and fireworks seemed better at Disneyland, so it depends what you are looking for. We did one day at each and if I only had 1 day available we all agreed we would have done California Adventure. Both parks were fun though, just be prepared for the crowds from afternoon and later even on the weekdays. Our favorite rides were Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, and Pirates of the Caribbean in that order. ",Disneyland_California,136

Please be awear that the prices are appoxamatley 2euros higher that posted on their web site. It is ridiculous that we can have a fast pass for rides and not resturants as this makes a very unpleasant time for us and anyone else in the queue as it is very difficult to amuse a child with his disability for this length of time so be awear and take a packed lunch you can eat out side the numerous number of shut resturants.,Disneyland_Paris,134

Disneyland has always been clean and efficient and have top notch rides and shows but is it really worth $125 per person when it is extremely crowded and they continue to gouge you for money once you are inside the park? I don't think so. Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are visiting the parks and make sure this won't break your budget. Once you are there, enjoy the fun and try not to get upset with the crowds. Disneyland is really the best for amusement parks. It is just the price to enjoy the day with your family that must be taken into account. Have a magical day!",Disneyland_California,135

The park was cleaned constantly the costumes of the characters were faultless as was the scenery. Everyone was smiling end even the food wasn't as expensive as we thought. however some of the kiosks and caf  s were closed even in August!

The parade was excellent and the characters christmas outfits were brill.

Also, Indiana Jones was closed. There were 4 other attractions that were also closed. I understand that they have to be shut down to do maintenance and renovation but why so many at the same time?

In hindsight this was a waste of money as you only get to by pass three main rides and three stage events. So really not worth the money at all. Surprisingly we spent the whole day there. Had heard that some people spend less time, but I don't see how you could without cutting out on some rides. Food was ordinary but standard fare to what you would normally expect at an amusement park. Fireworks at the closing time are well worth the wait. Great way to end the day. Really well coordinated. Best way to travel to from city is definitely by the incredibly efficient MTR trains. ",Disneyland_HongKong,135

Yes, it has historical importance but it feels weird to drive through this quite large city and boom, you're in Disneyland. It doesn't build up the excitement like Walt Disney World does. That is my only real gripe. The park is 1 3 the size of MK but that's not a big deal. No detail is missed, it is as magical, it's fun, all the rides I have learned to love are there and then some! Indiana Jones ride is awesome! The pirate ship in the lagoon is gorgeous and pirates of the Carribean is great. I would no doubt go back.",Disneyland_California,121

Food is expensive but you wouldnt expect anything less when they can charge you whatever they like! Saying that, now I have been to Disneyland I probably wouldn't go again until I had kids   being with my boyfriend was great fun but just not the same vibe as kids bring to a place like that!

Cheerful, bright and colourful with Christmas music all around. The parades are brilliant especially the Christmas one which takes place throughout the day. If you stand near the entrance end you even get artificial snow falling on you whilst you watch. Stick around for the lighting of the Christmas tree each afternoon because that is quite entertaining and the laser and firework display in the evening at the castle is spectacular and one you really must not miss. Great for the small children too because there were so many meet and greets with the Disney characters. I visited in May for the Spring parade but this was much more entertaining.

Food was very expensive and of average quality but the service was very slow (at all of the quick service restaurants). On average we waited 25mins  for our food and often found that menu items weren't available only at the point we were ordering. Also at no point were we offered any apologies for the wait or lack of menu items   which indicates to me that this is just the norm.Also   the food counters all start to close at least half an hour before closing, so if you want to get a quick bite to eat before the fireworks you can't!",Disneyland_Paris,128

This place is not close to city and it takes around 30 40 min by taxi to travel there and you can also take train to disneyland. I would recommend to purchase tickets online to avoid long queues.

There were lots of food outlets which seemed nice but beware it is very pricey!! We then went into the Movie park and straight onto the Tower of Terror which was absolutely brilliant!!! After two go's on the Rockin Rollacoaster we were all a bit dazed!! We bought some lovely crepes and a hot chocolate which was very needed.

Plenty of refuelling stops, lots of merchandise to purchase relevant to the area theme and plenty of seats to sit and just chill. We had a 2 day pass and it was well worth it, to purchase the extra day was only $40, whereas if we had purchased a 2nd separate day it would have cost the full fee and believe me $40 is a lot cheaper than $480.

Make sure you do your home work and get fast passes for the rides you really want to do or you will be disenchanted with the long waits. Some tips. Go on the single rider lines where they are provided as they are much quicker. You can only get one fast pass at a time so make sure you get the ones you want.

Fast passes were life savers, especially with little ones. The staff is so helpful. Use the train to take you land to land, especially after a long day. Also use the monorail to get to the restaurants in Downtown Disney and then return that way. It saves your feet a lot of walking. Early mornings and late evenings cut the ride times down. It is expensive so plan on that as well. Take your own water because you will pay over $4 for a bottle.

Rides were inefficiently managed with 4 or more seats in a row going unfilled on rides despite lines for rides. Cast members spending time hanging out with each other instead of paying attention to customers and their job. Very few employees had that Disney upbeat spirit we've grown to love at Disney World. Very disappointing experience. I like grumpy but not in staff members. Just seemed like it was hard to find a cast member that wanted to be there.

I know things break but compared with other theme parks i have been to this one has things happening all too frequently.Food and Drink prices are ridiculous.    7.99 for a basic Hot Dog.    3.90 for a 33cl bottle of Water were 2 highlights.

592551239,5,2018-5,United Kingdom,It was our first time to go to Disney Paris. We were so surprised to see how many people were there considering it was not school break. The place is always packed but there is so much to do and many attractions to see. Most of the staff speaks more than two languages which was very helpful. The parades and the illumination were the highlights of our trip. I was amazed by how great the characters were in portraying their roles. I wonder how long it took them to train how to smile and wave like real Disney prince and princesses. We were quite lucky because it was their 25 year anniversary so we got a really good deal. 25% off our hotel and it was half board as well. We are definitely visiting again,Disneyland_Paris,135
440315116,2,2016-11,United Kingdom,"I am a huge fan of Disney and the Disneyland theme parks, and regularly visit the parks in Florida. However, the rides here are very run down (eg. Speakers in the rock n rollercoaster not working). My main complaint is the customer service   the staff were not helpful and and often very rude. For example, it was about 7.05pm and a staff member had directed me to the nearest toilet, however we were refused entry because we did not have the  extra magic hours  wristband. I could understand being refused entry to a ride, but to the toilet?! That is a absolutely ridiculous. A toilet is an amenity. We spent another 20 minutes getting to the next toilet as the park was so crowded. Will not be returning to Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris,131
285143032,2,2015-6,United States,"Went to Disneyland yesterday and it totally missed my expectations. There were broken rides everywhere! Indiana Jones, Barges to the Island, Pirates of the Carabean, Peter Pan.... Some would be down for an hour some would be down more. Went over to the California Adventure Park and the Elevator Ride only had one of three elevators working. And the Crowds!!! If you are going to have broken rides then reduce the number of people entering the park. There were a lot of Disney Characters but those lines were long...always. The park is getting old and tired. They should either get their mechanical act together or reduce the number of tickets available. I recommend Six Flags or another park. You get some of the same kind of thrill rides without the high entry cost. Sad",Disneyland_California,134

There were people smoking all over, even though there are clearly marked signs saying that was not allowed. There was trash in the streets, people cutting in line, and lots of dirty tables at each cafe we entered. I think the thing that bothered me most was the number of rides that were closed    above and beyond the ones that were listed on the website. We knew those would be closed, but then to go and find several others were closed as well, we really felt like we had been cheated by having to pay for a full price ticket. I shall look forward to returning to Disney World Orlando.",Disneyland_Paris,140
268276818,5,2015-4,Germany,A must visit place if you enjoyed Disney magic as a child..if you know their characters and stories. Some tips1. Stay overnight and do go for the laser show at night2. Try to get a map and collect information about the place beforehand.. so that you do not waste precious time figuring out the place3. Another reason to prepare beforehand...so that you are cued in on which rides and attractions you would like to visit..4. Rides and attractions can have very long wait times.. so prepare to be patient5. Food can be quite expensive.. so better to opt for full board option if you are staying over6. You would be on your feet most of the time.. so be prepared,Disneyland_Paris,120

It was a good exposure for the kids to the rides, typical Disneyland entertainment (shows, parades, dining) including the long queues. We took advantage of the attraction tickets (time based) to avoid the queues where we could and this helped to save time.

The littlest ones will like the Small World and Autopia rides and the parades with princesses on floats.If you go on a public holiday, especially a holiday in mainland China, then you should expect big crowds.If you go in June July Aug, the sun can be pretty harsh and the humidity high.

The gift shop has set up displays so they are low enough for even a child in a stroller to grab onto a toy and want to keep it. it is best to have a plan before entering the park and that includes a budget. The many attractions and numerous food venders can tempt anyone. Most importantly, have a place to meet in case you are separated. The place can be very crowded. Lots of things to do and see.

The staff understand English perfectly well if euros are mentioned or required, but should you raise a concern or complaint, forget it, total lack of customer service, ignorance and rudeness you will never experience anywhere else...... shame really because if they adopted the same mentality as their colleagues in the states then it would be a more pleasurable experience.

So, yes, we are discriminating when it comes to Disney.Our first and probably only visit to Disneyland was special but much less magical. We knew the size of the park, compared to the WDW parks, were small. So our 2.5 days in the parks were more than enough to see and do everything we wanted to do.There are plenty of great attractions: Indiana Jones, Matterhorn, Pirates, Small World and so on. Just not enough of them.Additionally, it was odd seeing so many cast members coming and going.

My brother fell ill during this visit and just had to stay at the hotel with my mom taking care of him. They enjoyed the hotel while we were enjoying the park.There are definitely more people at Hong Kong Disneyland than in California Disneyland.

Be aware however, that once you get a Fast Pass reservation, you are prevented from getting another one for a period   either until the first one expires, or about an hour or so before it expires. We got a reservation for a popular ride that was four hours in advance of when we took it, and the stand by queue was then only 60 minutes, so consider your tactics.

I was really bummed because we had wanted to see the haunted mansion all dressed up. We still had loads of fun and they can't control the weather. Didn't realize they don't have an evening firework show except a few nights a week. Overall takeaway is I wish I would have planned better. We have been to Disney world over 10 times and there was really no comparison to it in my opinion. I didn't like how there was no meal plan or fast passes link that we have grown accustomed to at Disney world. ,Disneyland_California,129

There was no notices anywhere saying this? We was a bit angry at this. Wouldn't recommend going in January as the park is quiet so they feel they can shut rides, a lot of the food stalls were closed too, only the restaurants were open.

It was definitely still fun for the kid, on the bright side it didn't take forever to get the kid fed or something to drink when she was thirsty, and there was a few rides that she was willing to go on so yea mission accomplished for the toddler, but I went alot as a kid and remembered it differently, now I know why you my dad and step mom literally got into a fight there...haha",Disneyland_California,132

Love Pirates of the Caribbean here in Disneyland, as well as New Orleans Square theming, the Casey Jr Train, the Storybook Land Canal Boats, the train, and all of the dark rides (Snow White's Scary Adventure and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, both of which used to also be at WDW, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio, Peter Pan).

Not only is the price no different than Florida, but it's smaller, which means it has fewer rides and activities, and is poorly organized   layed out. More than 10% of the rides   attractions were closed for  maintenance  with no prior heads up, not even when we bought additional tickets locally the day before going to the park.

This place have different parks for big and small guests. Which i found not very appealing as you have to buy tickets for them separately. You can't have super rides and disney parade in one ticket.

Arrive at the park at LEAST 30 minutes before official opening. Oh and one more thing  if you take a backpack or purse on Indiana Jones, be sure to put your leg through the strap.

A couple of tips: they have apps now on smart phones, where they update you on the ride status, ride wait times etc. They are not always correct but can give you a good idea of what to expect.

Keep a map handy and watch for character sightings and photo ops. ,Disneyland_California,135
499592705,4,2017-5,United States,"Disneyland is quite an amazing and unique place to visit. The atmosphere makes it feel like you left anaheim and entered a separate world.The food inside is amazing and unique to wherever you are in the park. The rides will remind you of the movies you saw as a child. The characters are lovely to meet with the kids. The parade and fireworks at night are amazing.Now the but of this review. I am a local (as in I live 4 blocks down Ball Rd) so I like to visit disneyland when it's not crowded. Over the years however, it's become so popular that it's ALWAYS crowded. If you decide to visit Disneyland, be prepared for waiting in long lines.",Disneyland_California,120
348306911,1,2016-2,United States,"disney does not limit sales so they pack the park full daily and then you have to compete with thousands of people in line for each attraction...in between you are treated rudely and hollered at by crowd control as they herd you every which way because of the parades that are never ending and that if you don't get a seat several hours ahead of time you don't see, the herding continues for fantasmic, and again for the fireworks where you are placed in roped off pens as crowded as a tokyo subway car ..if you deviate the crowd control people are downright nasty...none of this occurs at disneyworld in florida... this place has made a quick trip downghill...amazing what corporate greed can do to a good time",Disneyland_California,128
394114326,4,2016-6,United States,"Disney CAN be done in one day if you are traveling with older kids or adults (I've done it twice in the last 6 months). Make sure to arrive when the gates open & go straight for the rides you want on, You can easily hit Indiana Jones, Pirates, Haunted House, Splash Mountain & Thunder Mountain all within a short time and with minimal wait times. By afternoon, the place is a mess of lines and crying kids. Take advantage of Fast Passes! We had a 3 hour wait for Space Mountain, but by the time we were allowed in line, we hopped to the front & waited maybe 10 minutes. I recommend leaving the park for dinner & some rest in the late afternoon to return for the parade and fireworks. It really is an amazing show right now! ",Disneyland_California,140
469145367,1,2017-3,United States,We visited the Happiest Place on Earth on Match 13 and 14 2017. It is widely known by all including Disney that this week was spring break in Arizona and other states that people flock from to go to DL.Tuesday the 14th was extremely crowded and hot. Guess what only 1 monorail running that day. WHY?My wife's back was really hurting her so she was going to take monorail back to downtown Disney to go to our room at the DL hotel and walk.She waited 1 hour before she was able to take the monorail!!Disney is usually known for having their ducks in a row and all their bases covered.Not this time with only 1 monorail operating at this very very busy time is very poor planning.,Disneyland_California,127
172302573,3,2013-8,United States,"Disneyland was Okay but not something I would even think about going back to any time soon. I am a spoiled Disney World person. The wow factor is NOT there with Disneyland. The people are not nearly as friendly who work there, the people standing holding signs talking about porn and sexual stuff in front of my kiddos was not a highlight either. Disney World is a way of life for the people who work there, Disneyland is not. I am also disappointed in the meal selections for ages 10 to 15. I understand Disney is considering these  adults  and charging them adult prices, but they have nothing that a 10 year old would want to eat. It's ridiculous. The park itself lacks the room that Disney World Magic Kingdom has. Overall, I would not return here anytime soon.",Disneyland_California,139

My wife was devastated that Big Thunder Mountain was closed.We visited on a Tuesday in mid May, so it wasn't too busy. short lines for everything.We really love California Adventure.  Soarin' over California  is almost worth the entrance fee by itself, although the big attraction we had come 5,500 miles to see was worth the trip   Cars Land (Radiator Springs) was wonderful. Full of the usual high design standards and little Disney Pixar jokes. Had to wait in line for an hour to go on the big ride, but it did not disappoint.",Disneyland_California,138

Rides are well maintained and kept modern despite being mainstay attractions from the 60's.Fast pass ride are underwhelming. Only 6 for the entire park. Like the concept but they need more. disabled  guests are able to jump the line and cut past people waiting for an hour. We understand that some cannot manage the rat maze lineups. When one disabled individual arrives at the ride with an entourage of 6   assistance  people in tow just makes the problem worse. This happened all day at almost every attraction. If its a 45min wait for the ride, make these guests wait just as long as the rest of us.Parade and fireworks were excellent. Well done!",Disneyland_California,121

We grew up in California, so I have fond memories of Disneyland, however since living on the east coast and having been to Disneyworld now twice, I have to hand it to World. From the service, to the cleanliness, to the ride selection, the various other things to do in the park, the shows & parades...hands down World wins. The castmates seemed bored, if you had a question it was hard to find someone to help, and there were really very few rides my 8 and 11 yr old wanted to do. The 'castle' in the center of the park is nothing in comparison to Cinderella's at World...I found myself looking around thinking it was dated and kind of sad.

I wasn't sure what to expect but once you allow yourself to be a kid (and be a little silly), it can be a ton of fun. We only bought the one day pass for Disneyland and there was plenty to do to occupy the day. We were a little miffed at the crowds for a Monday in February (why weren't all those kids in school??) but the lines weren't terrible for any ride. The extra $10 for FASTPASS is totally worth it. Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it was still extremely slow and somewhat inefficient actually getting into the park. We arrived just before 10am and it still took almost 90 minutes before we got through the front gate.",Disneyland_California,137

A lot of rides were either broken or in maintenance, and even the best ones, like the Aerosmith Rock'n Roller Coaster, Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars hyperspace Mountain.We spent our fast pass in the Big Thunder Mountain, which got closed while we were in the fast pass queue to enter it, due techinical problems! And it was not solved that day! And due the time restrictions, we were unable to reschedule it.The Fireworks show was too late, when we reached the metro station in Paris, the metro was already shutdown, take care when planning it.If you already visited the Florida parks, don't waste your time.

Overall the theme park was nice, plenty to do and plenty of food   drink stops. The rides were busy and queues were quite long. This did not bother us as we were there to see the park and not really into the rides. I would probably recommend the 'front of line passes' as this would alleviate the large lines waiting. Good for the kids though with plenty of characters walking around. I would avoid holiday period again though, not sure if it makes a difference or not. Been there now and would not be in a hurry to go back. Wasn't quite what we expected.",Disneyland_California,135
540632901,1,2017-11,United Kingdom,Visited the park on Veterans day. Massive queue of traffic just to get to the parking ticket booth. Fortunately I had already bought the park entry tickets as the line to buy was also long. The park must have been at capacity as there was really only space to stand for each person. Even with fast passes and arriving early in the morning we managed to get only a small number of rides. 145 minute wait to ride on  its a small world  was unbelievable. I do not recommend wasting your valuable time and effort coming to this park. If you wish to see Disney go to magic kingdom on the east coast. For me this was not a good experience which was quite surprising.,Disneyland_California,125

Though it was chilly we had the best weather that day and the place looked magical :) The ticketing and the entrance was hassle free and faster than expected. We didn't like much of the foods available at the resort as it was really bland and tasteless. There was a lot of activities to choose from and thought the rides were short it was ok as the wait for the rides were not long either. We got to see the Flights of Fantasy from the front row and it was pretty cool. Recommend waiting for the night light show. Definitely worth a visit if you are in HK :)",Disneyland_HongKong,124

I booked hotel DLP hotel shuttle with Prestige Transfer and that was well worth the $. We left our Paris hotel at 8:30am and left Disneyland at 8:30pm, which for us was perfect. The park feels quite different than the other Disney parks. For instance, no characters walk around, very few kids are wearing Disney ears, and there are fewer venders. The castle and grounds are beautiful, however. I would highly recommend hitting the park. Ignore the people who look at you aghast when you mention DLP.

Well, that was a disappointment: the park is very small, expecially when compared to the ones in the US, and, considering the number of visitors, the time spent in the heat queuing can soon become unbearable (only 2 attractions offer fastpass). The cost of the entrance ticket is huge and even drinks and food are quite expensiive.I also found the park lacking some of that special Disney atmosphere which makes Disney theme parks unique and attractive not only to kids but also to adults.The park is very clean and, unlike other reviewers, we did not have any problems with the local visitors.",Disneyland_HongKong,122

Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids.

The smells, the atmosphere, the workers (or excuse me...they are called cast members, which is perfect because they really are putting on a show. A show of friendliness and pure joy), the characters, the rides. It's all just classic and fun. Yes, it's busy at pretty much any time of the year (there are some exceptions, but then at those times many rides are closing for maintenance). And yes, it is outrageously expensive and you just about have to take out a second mortgage to get your family there. BUT, if you can swing it, DO IT and go!

We followed the guide all day and we didn't have to wait any longer than 30 minutes for rides and we saw everything. I highly recommend getting this book before you go!We were in the park for 13 hours and the guide did involve a lot of walking, but we managed to get everything done in one day.The food was average, but as you would expect for a theme park.The rides were great and lots of fun.

Its always going to be difficult at New year in poor conditions but the queues were large and the costs for food seem to have gone up...We went out to the nearby McDonalds and saved a fortune. Seeing the New Year in was slightly disappointing, we were expecting a firework spectacular and got a light show that nobody could see.

Breakfast environment good and did not feel rushed or cramped as in Sequoia Lodge. Inside the Park was where the real disappointment came. Not so many characters available around the park as there used to be. Parades no longer get the children involved. We had blue badge passes for easy access to rides, only to find that some rides now have a booking system   this was not explained at the time of pass issue at City Hall.

486258356,5,2017-4,United States,"Disney is a magical place for the young and old. It is more magical when it's not swamped with people though!! I do recommend looking up crowd calenders on the internet before planning a trip. We have 2.5 year old and wouldn't go the day without her stroller. There is a wine bar to chill at while she is napping. Plus there is no way she could make it all day running around. We also stay about a mile away so it is needed for the walk to and from. Do get schedules for parades, fireworks, shows, etc and make dining reservations ahead of time for a more pleasant trip. I also recommend getting fast passes early morning.

In fact, the lines were much longer in Novemeber than they are in the summer. Most of the waits were over 60 minutes, so fast pass was required. You definately either need 3 days to do most of the rides or enough stamina to stay all day up until closing to get your fill of all the events. It rained one day and was cold, the park looked rather desserted and felt quiet too. Most of the rides are closed when it rains and there is no parade or fireworks, so don't expect too much Disney magic if the weather is not cooperating.

Theme rides which you cue for under an hour which was worth it, its Disneyland you can't whinge about that. Expect crowds, not overpriced food outlets, make sure you get a two day pass so you can just cover all areas of the park.Spend the money to stay a the Disney resorts.

We planned on visiting family in Scottsdale, AZ, and since it was a short 6 hour drive to Anaheim, CA to visit Disneyland, we went for it! What a great time! One advantage to DL over WDW is the closeness of both parks and Downtown Disney. Its a short walk form each on property hotel to both DL and Disney California Adventure. No buses or long shuttle and monorail lines. The parks are smalled; therefore, the walk between attractions is less. Another big advantage to DL!

She lives Winny the Pooh ride and the small world journey.The only complaint I have is that the food in all of the park is costly ( even for a theme park) and is not good at all.Their food standard has been abysmal for the last 7 years I have been going there.

I have been to the park several times but this was the first time during the holidays. The downside is that the park is going to be pretty busy. I rode three heavily trafficked rides using fast pass during the parade. $92 for a single day ticket is pretty steep, but I don't get to go everyday, so didn't mind the price.

We also did not expect filthy overflowing toilets   come on Disney! Also, when you pay extra for Halloween party tickets it is somewhat annoying that the roads are blocked so you have to get off your bus and walk.

Then to have lots of the park closed, prices for all related products and poor food bordering on highway robbery was the final straw. Sadly the French have just not got the flair to run this size of operation and that combined with it's location made for a very disappointing visit. You expect to queue going to Disney but 2 hours plus for some rides is too much especially with young children. Having rides closed just adds to the problem with more people for fewer rides.

The one thing I would have to complain is Everywhere we were there was a person smoking next to us. Smoking everywhere, lines waiting for the rides, by the washroom, everywhere at restaurants.just crazy smoking. Come on people! Its a kids place.

Understand that a big part of Disneyland is soaking up the atmosphere and just appreciating the fact that you're there. Use FastPass wisely to cut some of the waiting time.It's really more fun without the kids!

We went at the end of May on a week day and so it was so quiet you didn`t have to queue for any of the rides. This meant that as big kids we could go on the horses, the tea cups and the boat rides time and time again if you wanted.

Much like the California cousin, the park has a beautiful entrance to Main Street USA which leads you to the Sleeping Beauty Castle. From this point radiates different  lands . The layout is almost identical except the rides are fewer, but at the same time they are often a bit more leaner and keener.

Highlights have to be the Lion King show (footnote, other Disney parks   add it to your roster, it's truly truly wonderful and in Anaheim it would complement the live Aladdin show so well) and Grizzly Gulch   prepare yourself for a surprise !!!

My daughter is three and she was so star stuck by seeing her fav characters.If you have a princess mad girly like we do i would recomend getting to the Princess Pavillion as soon as the park opens to avoid the 90 minute wait! Also if you hang outside the paviollion on the hour and half hour you will see the princesses going in and then coming out. My daughter was super pleased with this as she not only met Cinderella but also saw five other princesses.

(certain attractions, like Peter Pan, Dumbo, Snow White). Other things are different but very nice. (Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, etc). The staff at the park are all very nice and there are lovely shops with which to shop for souvenirs. The only caveat I have is to check beforehand which restaurants wil be open when you visit. There are times days when they are not all open. This is not a terrible thing but just something to be aware of if say you have family members with diabetes or other conditions that might require them to get a hold of something to eat or drink in a hurry.",Disneyland_Paris,130

I was lucky enough to have an interaction with Alice and the Mad Hatter and was able to get pictures with them as well!

Love all of parades, daytime and nighttime, especially the firework performance @8.30PM. Frozen show and the Lion King show was amazing, we really love. I would like to thank all of Disneyland members who gave all of us great parades, all member who wear Pooh, Mickey Mouses and all Disney's characters clothes, you guys are very great and work really hard.

At our visit the EuroDisneyPark Unfortunately suffered a number of maitenance closures and break downs.Especially in Wonderland, waitingtimes are tough. In the Studios it   s only af few of the rides though, that operates with up to 1 hour waitingtime. The Disneyland Express should run until near the closing og the park, and not stop already at 17. The park needs shady benches for babysitting patents and grandparents, spacy restaurants and non  deep fried dishes.

It seems, to me, if Disneyland is no longer catering to children and trying to cater to the 20   35 year old age group. Characters were great with our grandchildren. The evil queen from Snow White was fantastic, thanks Cindy for letting us see her.Food is getting very expensive, this place is a money making machine. Hope they quit raising prices on everything.Please don't take this as a negative review, we had a great time. I know change must occur, but don't forget what brought you to this point.

The kids absolutely loved it, there was so many things to do for both the young and the elder people. One of my favourite moments were queuing to take photos with the disney characters which was definitely worth it, pictures are now in my photo album. Food there is good, perhaps a little pricey even but there are many snack places to go that you should visit. If you stay in the evening, the fireworks are a must  see since they were a brilliant way to end the day! They have loads of places to purchase unique souvenirs too, we splashed out a little there!

The park has the traditional Disney atmosphere with lots of activities and stores to keep you busy. Activities for all ages from kids to teenagers   then again which adult doesn't turn into a kid when they see Mickey Mouse. You'll need stamina to walk and if it's a busy day, you'll need patience to wait in the lines. There are no traditional fast passes, look around as each popular ride has a unique fast pass method through vending machines. The food options are basic and can get very very busy at meal times. We waited for 30 mins at one location for a table and then ended up moving to another area of the park just to get a bite. ",Disneyland_HongKong,134

Oh and a small umbrella for shade in the long wait of a line. Some baby wipes to wipe your kids faces cause it does get hot.Just carry all in a backpack so your hands can be free.

So 4 hours of my life wasted. The placed needed a lick of paint. Want to meet the characters? Forget it, quing for hours to have a photo with a guy dressed in a suit is not worth it. Biggest waste of my money and time. Did I mention the wasps, makes quing interesting.

If you're staying at one of the Disney hotels you can get into the park 2 hours before it opens to the public so make advantage of this, also when the parade is on the queues are smaller too.

Better to be seated at 5.30 pm as it becomes very crowded at 6.The live shows ( Lion king, etc), Mickey 3D show are worth watching. Fast pass is mainly for Meet and Greet characters.

The Big Thunder Mountain ride was good and Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast. Some big rides were closed for refurbishment. Very long queues   100 minutes plus. So be very chilled and tolerant! Managed to get to see a few characters   Minnie and Goofy after very long queues. The PhotoPass is a good idea or you get stung constantly with photo opportunities which very quickly mount up. Fun parades. The highlight was the closing show with the castle. Absolutely amazing light and laser show with fountains and loads of fireworks.

Some people feel that the attractions are outdated, but the long lines waiting to get into rides like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and It's A Small World are proof that these older technologies are still able to charm and entertain. Our group included children and adults and no one was disappointed. We stayed for 8 days and still didn't get to see and do everything although we did repeat our favorite rides several times.

Go in the middle of the week if possible because it isn't as busy, the longest we waited for a ride was 30 minutes, and even though you wait it's still an experience. The best rides for adults and kids over 7 were Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly runaway minecars. When it comes to food I highly recommend taking snacks and water. With the water though you can fill them up at the water stations.

Highlights included the Jedi Training (get there early and register your child), Star Tours, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones, which is an incredibly unusual ride. The only thing that let the park down was the overpriced food and drink which was not good in our opinion.Shopping here is amazing and the theming of all the shops is done so well.The parade was wonderful and so was the Main Street Electrical Parade.Altogether an excellent day.",Disneyland_California,124

However, it turns out we have only used our pass a few days this year  barely worth buying the pass. You see, the park itself seems much more crowded than Orlando because it has much of the same rides attractions but they are compressed into a smaller area. In addition, they don't offer the waterparks, which are a nice diversion on hot days in Florida.

Line up for the parade at least 45 mins early to get a good view. We preferred the Walt Disney Studios park as its smaller and the parade is earlier so you get back to the hotel earlier.

Lots of food stations and restaurants dotted around, toilets were clean and plentiful. There wasn't a parade at the end of the day due to the fact it had rained and health & safety because of this.

Of course, Disneyland had Mr. Toad's Wild Ride which was closed at the Magic Kingdom and is one of my 'favorite' story ride.It does seem more crowded than Magic Kingdom just because the park is not as spread out , but line length was comparable to Magic Kingdom.",Disneyland_California,123

Magic mornings only come with a 3 day pass or higher. I also recommend the park hopper ticket because it allows you to go to either Disneyland or California Adventure in the same day.

The highlight was the light show fireworks but why are they on so late?? Most kids are exhausted by that point, and I spent a very long 20 mins carrying her for the show which she didn't want to miss but equally was wiped out and couldn't even enjoy the show.

So maybe think about paying the money to book a time to get in there as the idea of a queue in France is not the same as everywhere else in the world I have been.All in all this is a great place to go, it is expensive to buy toys etc but you should be expecting that.

Not all the food places were open in the park so quite limiting and busy. The parades are so beautifully choreographed and the costumes are amazing. No doubt we will be back. ,Disneyland_Paris,127

Compared to California Disney some of the rides were low budget ex: Indiana Jones, Nautilis... And some of the rides were missing entirely   Splash mountain. There was construction and a few rides were closed do to it.   Big Thunder Mountain. Over all we had a fun time, there were lots of characters running around and a parade. Space Mountain 2 was wild and so was the Aroesmith Roller Coaster. We saw super cool stunt show by Renault, and a crazy Tarzan show with great acrobatics.We had fun, but it didn't quite compare to Disney California.",Disneyland_Paris,122
231999760,4,2014-9,Australia,We purchased online from the officail site three adults and one child ticket. So with printed vouchers one of the adults and the child went up to the ticket office but were told all of the four people had to be there. This is stupid as each voucher has the persons name on it. So Disney Paris staff cancelled the two other adult tkts for some stupid reason so the first adult and child could go in. So when my husband and I went there we had to line up at customer service to get our tkts re issued. We asked why on earth did they cancel oyr tkts and inconvenie ce us all they said was that it was their procedure. So what is the point if buying online in the first place,Disneyland_Paris,134
296949068,5,2014-12,United Kingdom,My favourite place in the world :) our 4th time in 4 years...absolutely magic. We love the rides and parades and usually eat in the Plaza Gardens where there's always a great selection to keep even our fussy eater happy. The staff are always really helpful   when my sons autograph book got lost in the restaurant they directed us to customer services who replaced it straight away   and the attention to detail around the park is really fantastic. The only downside of our last visit was how busy it was over the weekend as we've always been mid week before. I did think there was less happening around the park than our last Christmas visit (2010) but the end of day show is really incredible. We can't wait to go back this December for my 30th birthday :),Disneyland_Paris,138

We had an amazing time, it was very busy but we used fast passes and manage all the rides we wanted to go on. All the meet and greet character were very good taking time with each child and not rushing. Meals in some restaurants were very expensive but others no so, so it   s up to you how much you budget for. Snacks were expensive but we took our own. And bottle water, it was    3.19 for a bottle of water but you can fill up your own at different places around the park. Security staff at the entrance wasn   t the friendliest. We walked on average 20,000 steps a day so wear comfy shoes!",Disneyland_Paris,133

Resort goers have a wide option of rides to choose from  the mild one (Small World) to the most thrilling (like Space Mountain!). Photos that were offered as options (and not forced) were also a good fallback for visitors. Park was clean and there was assurance of our safety. There were plenty of choices for eating places. The shows, of course, bore the trademark of a Disney production, magical and entertaining! I will always want to go back!

All the rides where good and the park was very clean be prepared to wait to meet the princesses 75 mins when we did it and you have to choose left or right then it's a surprise which one you get we had rapunzel the other side was Snow White.

The castle wasn't as big as I expected but it was still awesome. Indeed lots of families but we just ignored that. There's plenty to eat and drink around. If you're planning to do Splash Mountain get ready to get wet but it's not insanely drenched. If you do it while the sun is out you'll be dry quickly.

If this is your first time visiting a Disneyland and never been to any before, you surely will be left in amaze and wow.But after been to several DL around the world, I had to say, this is one of the  smaller  version with shorter rides.

The park was pristine! The new healthy food choices were welcomed by me. I thought that the entertainment was excellent. Disney offers a great value for vacation dollar spent. Their attention to detail is always noticeable and appreciated by me. I loved being at the original park for its 49th anniversery!

Too many people let in for the size of the park and the amount of rides characters shows. This leads to excessive queuing time, a scrum to meet the few characters around and I would think a health and safety risk should the park need to be evacuated in a hurry.French staff disinterested and lack organisational skills.Very expensive and mediocre food available in the park, being your own!Just a feeling of corporate greed being put way before ensuring customers have a great time.

A lot less waiting around than other times we have visited other Disney Parks. One ride did break down on us and we had to be    rescued      which in reality was the park staff trekking to the stricken carriage with some step ladders!

In the wider scheme of things our weekend being different than expected was not an issue, however I am very disappointed in Disney who are refusing to refund on the unused tickets stating that it is not within the terms and conditions.

We did get fast pass tickets for a few rides but the timings between them meant we could only manage two a day.There were only a few characters to get autographs from in the parc with very long lines.At lunch time we stopped to get hotdogs & chips which cost 60 euros for five of us!You are also charged 25 euros per day for parking!Over all we did have a nice day, but the queues were frustrating and boring for the kids.",Disneyland_Paris,137

The Small Small World and Winnie the Pooh rides are suitable for toddlers and small babies. The Lion King show was entertaining with many sound effects.

Bathroom facilities were frequently dirty and smelt bad. Rides are often down due to  technical difficulties , this happened 5 times during our stay!

They could also do two main parades per day quite easily. We missed it because we had to queue 90 minutes to meet Princess Aerial.

I'm not a Disney fan but once you're there, you can't help but get taken in! Tomorrow land, with the new Star Wars themed rides were really fun and a definite favorite for the older kids in our family. With three kids of varying ages, we had to go in with a plan. You'll hear it many times, but it bears repeating: ride the popular rides early, get those Fast Passes, download an App with the wait times. The fried chicken is yummy and so are the beignets, wish I had room for a churro. ",Disneyland_California,125
468053212,5,2017-2,New Zealand,"What more can be said, this place is amazing. The staff are very well trained and organised, and despite the fact that they have to face a daily onslaught of thousands and thousands of people they manage to present Disneyland the way it should be. We were disappointed by some of the rides not being available (maintenance) but that has to happen sometimes. The crowds were huge, but they always are and Disneyland manages them amazingly well. The food items we purchased through the day were a lot better quality than I had been expecting (a lot better!)If you come to LA, Disneyland is a must visit place, at least once, with or without children  although I think children under the age of 6 7 would get overwhelmed pretty quickly. I'm definitely glad I went ",Disneyland_California,135
140071099,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We had a one day mission to complete both parks and succeeded. I guess we chose a good day to visit, mid week in September. The park did seem quite busy in areas but we managed to get on everything we wanted to with about two hours to kill before the Disney Dreams show at 9PM.Both parks were spotlessly clean and everything looked well cared for. The Disney Dreams show was absolutely fantastic.My top tip would be to get to the studios park first as this can be completed in a few hours then move on to the main park for the afternoon. We noticed a lot of people seem to do the parks the other way round as the studios park started to get very crowded from about 1PM.A fantastic day out!!",Disneyland_Paris,133
589577307,5,2018-6,United States,My family had never had as much fun as when we visit Disneyland Park. It is just like being a little kid again. I recommend getting there as soon as the park opens to help avoid lines. Also this time we used the Disney Max Pass app. It was $10 per person per day but it was worth it. We hardly waited in any lines at all. And instead of running across the park to get fast passes we could do it on our phones. It was really easy. It was also really hot the day we went so we had Dole Whips in the Tiki room and it was a great way to cool off. It was a magical experience. I can't wait to do it again.,Disneyland_California,128

I had the most amazing time and for the first time in a long time, I was amazed by everything.Staff were exceptionally nice and so helpful, even getting my wife and I on some rides super quick! make sure you try and get on your favourite rides right after the parade and fireworks, as the lines are super short. I got on splash mountain in 2 minutes!.Make sure you get a turkey leg to eat, and ride the single rider line when you can. It's a lot quicker then everything else, and you don't have to wait around for a fastpass. Staff will always help you find your favourite character ",Disneyland_California,120

Wonderful staff throughout the park, whether at places to eat, at stalls or in shops. All the staff are very knowledgeable about the park itself, great for those needing advise etc. Not as expensive as thought it would be and great variety of goodies to buy, places to eat and drink. You must stay to see World of Color, worth the wait for it. Lost a cap on a ride and got it back with very little hassle from lost and found in the park. Go early, get fast pass tickets where available and be prepared to spend many hours of fun in the sun.",Disneyland_California,121
148459281,2,2012-12,United States,This was probably the biggest disappointment of our trip. The place was so crowded you couldn't even walk. We have been to Disney World three or four times and never had crowds and waits like this. We were there for 14 hours and were only able to ride six rides and see one show. The whole fast pass idea is a flop. The radiator springs fast passes were gone before 11 am. I think it's time Disney made some changes. We would have gladly paid the extra $400 for a real fast pass like Six Flags offers. I will say that the Christmas decor was magnificent. Could not see the parades due to the crowds. Even the line to the Haunted Mansion was bad. Too crowded and too expensive for what little we got to do. Won't return.,Disneyland_California,138

Had lunch at a sit down restaurant in the park and I don't think I've ever been served a meal that was as poorly prepared as the one I received. My daughter had ribs and there was nothing but bones and fat covered in sauce. Our visit began with the woman in the ticket booth screaming at me and just went downhill from there. Skip it.

The parades very nice, the small world attraction excellent,dreamy!!

Get the Disneyland app before you go and familiarize yourself with it. Pay $10 to get the fastpasses through your phone, and you will also get to download all the pics that are taken of you by the photographers in the park. Much cheaper than buying pics there at the park. The app will also tell you the prices of food in the park so you can plan ahead. The app also tells how long the lines are for each ride so you can plan what you want to do next. The app will save you so much time, and it works for CA Adventures too! ",Disneyland_California,132

The Paint the Night parade was well worth the wait. Normally, I don't pay much attention to the parades, but I'm really glad we waited to check this one out. Very impressive. The firework display was fabulous as well.This trip we decided to get our silhouettes done on Main Street. The gentlemen who was doing silhouettes was wonderful. He has been a cast member for over 20 years. He even worked at Tokyo Disney. It was nice to have a moment to chat with a cast member. I feel like we don't always have the opportunity to do that.

This is a shout out to Ariel, Cinderella and Snow White. You all went over the top to make our little princess feel special, interacting with her! Ariel showed her how to twirl a princess dress.

Most are a sit down and relax and get a 3D interacting shor version of the movies, but still great to see. We went and there were no restuarants opened apart from 1 3 when there are so many to be founs in the park. However a buffet restuarant right near main street was amazing.

I have been to Disneyland in Paris, and Six Flags, and Canada's Wonderland, and other theme parks but never have I seen a theme park as busy as I experienced at Disneyland Anaheim.

Picking the right time to go is important...heat, crowds and overtired children make summer a no go zone for me...I prefer Winter when it's a little quieter.The park at night is not well lit and it's easy to feel anxious about keeping your family together.

They have a ceremony every day to retire our nation's flag and to honor all military personnel, active and veterans, and their families. It's so awesome to take your children and grandchildren and watch them have fun. It was disappointing that there weren't as many characters out interacting with the public as there has been in the past. We have been Annual Pass holders in the past, but the price increased so high that we couldn't afford to renew them. Unfortunately I think that the people in charge of Disneyland have forgotten what Walt Disney originally built Disneyland for. He didn't build it to make money, he built it for families to enjoy a wonderful and affordable time together. ",Disneyland_California,140

We saw Princess Anna and Queen Elsa ride through on a horse drawn carriage, saw the Christmas parade, and explored the entire park. The only downfall was the amount of people. If you're planning a trip, go when the park won't be as crowded. The average wait time for ANY ride was over an hour and a half. We ended up only riding one ride (Thunder Mountain) and stood in line for three hours. The firework show was cancelled due to weather conditions, so we were a little bummed but we still had a lot of fun exploring.

We went in October, and the Halloween themed decor, parade, and show were delightful. Fantasyland was a big hit with the kids, whereas my husband and I loved Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Adventureland (it was much better than the Disney World version!).

Usual freindly staff, long queues for popular rides and fastpass tickets if you get there when the gates open. Biggest shock was the number of ride closures for renovation, and if your going during 2016 2017 check disney paris site for ride closure information eg 7 main attractions in Disney park and 2 in the studios some over most of 2016 and into 2017. Other big change is the hotels don't have character visits during the day, not as many round the parks and no vehicle parade in the studio area. Cost cutting?

Her fav were Pirates of Caribbean ride , Buzz Lighter and Autopia. She refused to try Mad Hatter's Tea Cups and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, possibly because we have similar attractions at a local park. She didn't like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a bit too scary(but she enjoyed the pirates ride).

The staff checked several times to see if it had been turned in but no luck so far. Unfortunately it is a hat from several years ago that isn't made any more.

The big thrill rides aren't exactly overflowing, but they are fun once on them. Personally I think it can be done in a few days. Not sure if I have enough money to last much longer.

Now at holiday time Haunted Mansion is all done over in Tim Burton's  Nightmare Before Christmas  and it was outstanding. But my favorite attraction is Indiana Jones.

We were informed on the door that all outdoor attractions were closed and there would be no discounted tickets due to this which is highly disappointing considering over 90% of the attractions were outside! anyway... we decided to go in as we had made the journey all the way from Kowloon and we were really looking forward to our day out in Disney. I would say that it is not value for money at 530HKD, purely due to the fact that it is so much smaller than other Disney resorts. We enjoyed the magic of Disney anyway and had a great day after the rain had stopped and attractions had reopened!",Disneyland_HongKong,132

Disney has made many improvements in rides and entertainment but they come with a price. Crowds (supposedly below average day) were horrific. Since Disney started selling annual passes to local residents, the park has no  slow  days. Local residents  drop in  for a few hours and overwhelm the lines, food outlets, etc. The annual passes come with free parking and discounts on food and retail items. While I realize this is a business practice designed to increase  off time  crowds, I do think it has spoiled the experience for infrequent visitors. I liked the  old  Disneyland.

The attention to detail on the props, landscaping, buildings and rides is incredible. One thing that really stands out is how clean the entire park is. There's probably a garbage recycling bin every 10 feet and sanitation workers always on the move.We had a 3 day park hopper pass and it was worth every penny. We were also guests at the Disneyland Hotel so we got the extra magic hour. That alone made the park hopping that much better! The food selection isn't always the best because everything is fast food. Aside from that, it's a very special place!Piece of advice to you folks: plan ahead and use fast passes! Good luck!",Disneyland_California,138

On the Friday I was there it wasn't very crowded but Saturday was packed. I think most of the rides had a wait time of over an hour, so I would definitely recommend the fast pass. The parade got very crowded too with people lining up 30 minutes before for the best spots.Food drink in the park can be expensive but right outside the main entrance is the train station. There are two Relay convenience stores that sell water, beer, snacks, candy for one third the price. I stocked up my room there.",Disneyland_Paris,121

It was truly amazing because it's Disney .. however, we were quite annoyed to see just how many people they let in the park when they in no way had sufficient resources to accommodate for all. A prime example   for lunch we decided to grab something QUICK as it was 1pm and we had not been on a single ride yet as the queues were too long. We went to a hot dog takeaway restaurant on Main Street and queued for a total of 1.5 hours!!!

While all of the attractions worked, and were good, the main issues arose from the amount of people in the walkways. As the park has not updated its infrastructure, and the walkways are not designed to accomodate the hoard of people that decend on the park every day in the summer. My fear is how is the park going to cope with the amount of visitors the new Star Wars land is going to bring in.The inclusion of Star Wars in Tomorrowland felt very forced, and didn't bring anything to the park.On the other hand, the new nighttime parade, Paint the Night is excellent, and a massive step up to the already fantastic Electric Light Parade.",Disneyland_California,135

By going every couple of years it keeps it special for the kids and doesn't ruin the magic.We have two young girls   4 and 7   and to us Disneyland is preferable to Disneyworld. It is more or less the same but more compact and not as run over by huge tour groups from overseas. It is still crowded, don't get me wrong, but it is just more managable. I also like that you can leave and grab lunch and a beer at Downtown Disney without really going off campus   it is just next to it so it is walk able or you can take the tram from Tomorrowland.",Disneyland_California,133

All new characters, like Sophia and doc mcstuffisn are in the California adventure park.I would recommend to take your own food with you as the all meals and snacks inside are a bit expensive.

We spent our time at different rides and attractions and venues than the little ones, and we felt like we had to have the most amount of fun crammed into the 8 hours that we were at the park to get our money's worth.

It was drizzling and slightly windy on Saturday so that might have been the reason it was empty. The afternoon parade on that day was also different due to the weather.

Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits.

It's good to stroll around and marvel at the Disney works greatly surrounding you. Of course the highlight was the fireworks display at Sleeping Beauty's castle. It is highly accessible.

Even on the quietest weeks of the year, it is a madhouse. If you can overlook that, it is fantastic. My only real complaint is that the food quality is going down and the prices (for the park entrance and the food) are becoming astronomical. I would highly suggest planning a strategy to get the most from your day, including utilizing the fast passes when possible, and bring lots of snacks in your bags.

They have all the old favourites plus a few new cool rides. Hyper space mountain was our family favourite. And don't miss the Lion King show   it is basically a mini version of the stage show.

Restaurants are either very expensive or expensive for what you get. Most is fast food cheap carbs but you can get a salad.

Rides they could have done without: Winnie the Pooh, Alice and Wonderland, and similar rides.

Only downside was price of bottled water (the water fountains weren't working in the park) but you can purchase bottled water for much cheaper in the shop at the train station by the park entrance (handy to know if you have a purchase with you and don't have to carry the around in your bag all day).",Disneyland_Paris,130

The late afternoon parade is a must see. I would recommend going to the restaurants right outside the park, they have wonderful food and great atmosphere.

Numerous rides broken down and  or closed while on the ride, waiting for the ride, or in line for ride. Shuttles were too full to board and never on time, Ariel's Grotto was a hurry up and eat, blink and you miss seeing the princesses ($200 for our family of 5 to eat there). Very impersonal. Parade float broke down before Mickey's parade so it was 30 min late. During that same parade ANOTHER parade float broke down. After listening to Princess Tiana sing the same two songs four times, our daughters asked to leave the parade.Super shuttle went to wrong hotel to pick us up to take us to airport. Almost missed our plane ride home.Very disappointed. Will not go back.",Disneyland_California,135
281758763,5,2015-5,Australia,This was my first time visit to Disneyland and had a fantastic time. We spent 2 full days in Disneyland and 1 day in California Adventure. This is probably the best way to visit the Disneyland resort as you need more then 1 day in Disneyland. If you are able to plan your day and know your way around the park it is recommended to use the fast pass options available to you have less time waiting in lines. AND also look at getting a photo pass so you have added memories and not always buying singular rides on photos. One price for you entire stay. MAKE sure you have a go at everything even if you think it's just a kiddie's ride.,Disneyland_California,123

By 8.30 you start to queue, 10am queues range from 30 90min for a 60second ride, 11 11.30am queues are now 90 180 min, you can purchase   fast track passes and you wait 50% of the time!!!! If your children are under 8 yr , FORGET it, after traveling all over the world and visiting many parks built for entertainment , this is the worst by far, save your money and go to Florida , yes you still have queues , but 30min max, and they know what customer service is all about.",Disneyland_Paris,134

Firstly, the buses to and from the park. These very busy and when we do go back will avoid these at any cost and just box in taxis. These are so bad that the French people even pushed children out the way to get on the bus. We heard from a couple that there child was pushed to the floor and walked over!!

I visited Disneyland Paris for the second time to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday and we all agreed that some of the rides had become dated. The new rides in the Disney Studio using modern technology were brilliant and made our old favourites like Pirates of the Caribbean and Its a Small World seem really old fashioned. We still enjoyed it but decided that we would not rush to return until Disney had invested money to bring the whole park up to date. The fireworks display at the end of the evening was absolutely incredible. Don't want to think how much money they spend on each display. We all stood there mesmerised. It was worth visiting just for that. ,Disneyland_Paris,137

The rides are wonderful and the shows were amazing. We especially loved festival of the lion king. There are potable water stations near the washrooms where you can refill bottles. This is such a wonderful feature! Disappointments: I was disappointed that character greetings were marked on the brochure but when we went, there weren't any characters there. Some rides have no shaded area to stand in. Advice: bring an umbrella to make your own shade..... this will make or break your day. I hope you go and have a fun day!! ",Disneyland_HongKong,126

We went on a Weds and it was fairly crowded but even so, the longest wait we had was for Space Mountain.We were however very disappointed in the food choice. I have one child who is fairly selective in what they will eat. Many of the restaurants had limited choices. On the plus side, it was possible at some of those restaurants to get a power pack: string cheese, yogurt, goldfish, apples, and water.

Both visits we used Ridemax to plan our days at both Disneyland and California Adventure and it is crazy how much time it save you waiting in line! We love the way Disney carries its themes all the way though the park. The kids favorite food place was the pizza place in Tomorrowland. Both my husband and I loved the pasta there as well.

156822488,5,2013-4,United States,"What can I say. It's Disneyland. It's crowded, expensive and wonderful. Two suggestions. Consider staying at the (overpriced) Grand Californian or another Disney property so you get in an hour early. That first hour is golden, not as good as it used to be as Disney has expanded the universe of people who can get in early, but the lines are still substantially shorter in that hour. We did 9 kids rids just in that one hour, so the prices at the Grand Californian were worth it. Second suggestion is to buy reserved seating for Fantasmic (through Disney Dining). You get a reserved, padded seat, coffee and a nice little dessert tray, and you can stay in the same seat for the fireworks.",Disneyland_California,123

Most tour groups arrive around lunch time, so coming early will allow you to enjoy the rides without having to deal with long queues. It's easy to finish an area or two this way. Avoid coming on weekends or public holidays.

But thw difference in the experience is given by the services: staff in Disney Land Paris is completely unprepared, most of them doesn't like the work (or to work!). Disorganization is the rule. Long lines for everything even on a mid week working day of May. By Long lines I mean 60mins for a horse carousel riding for less than 3mins, 75 minutes to eat in a fastfood!!

We spent over 300 Euro for a family of five to enter and got to experience an average of three rides each. Not a good day especially when you queue for ages for a big ticket ride and it breaks down.

The only downside is that the place is very large and it gets a little tiring to walk around but it is worth it.

However, Disneyland is for kids and every one of those were enjoying themselves.

I guess this is what happens when a corporation (Disney) builds a park instead of a singularly talented, visionary man (Walt).Disneyland Paris has about one third of the attractions and way less fun than the parks in the States. Two of the marquee rides, Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain, were  closed  for no apparent reason   on a SATURDAY. French labor laws? Poor management? I don't know the answer but the result was plain: the park was a big disappointment.Save your Euros, Pounds, or Rupees for a trip to the States and the real deal!",Disneyland_Paris,132

It was possible to get on most of the big rides quite easily. Space Mountain, Star Tours, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean all provided thrills and great enjoyment. The theming is wonderful and the walks aren't too far to get from land to land. Food, however, is pricey and not very varied. Shopping choice is excellent with quality souvenirs for every pocket. The parade was lovely and really added to the ambiance. With the sun shining, you could almost believe you are in the US, the home of Disney. We wished we could have returned the next day.

Indian people attending are just rude with their pushing,having to be first demeanour in lines. We arrived by taxi ,5 of us from Canton Rd,Kowloon. $170HKD. The family loved the rides, we loved the shows, you have to be on the ball to ensure you arrive on time for the meet & greet with the characters , as they will only stay a while, then do a changeover as the heat would be too much in the character suits they wear.",Disneyland_HongKong,136

It was like $1800 bucks through the military deal for all four of us we went about 7 times in that year usually stayed 3 4 days but two trips were 5 6 days the tickets paid for themselves in two visits! You save on food merchandise and parking. Those costs add up. After our year was up we transferred out to the great state of Oklahoma and have only been back one time.

We tried to see as many shows as we could but the time of the shows were not printed on the maps they gave us at the entrance gate. So you have to go to the venue itself to get the time of the show and that's very tiring !  Buy your tickets for Disneyland at your hotel.

MY GOD I'm glad I did! This was amazing. Genuinely better for thrill seekers than Thorpe Park or Alton Towers. Some of the rides were truly incredible I was surprised they let 5 year olds on them!

Dumbo, Genie, Critter Corral was empty no animals at all. Buildings in the theme park fenced off for maintenance, handful of restaurants closed and boarded up. Very disappointed as the queues spoke for themselves. Seem to be less staff, major attractions such as Pirates had a one boat full next one empty, just as It's a small world did.Litter and rubbish throughout the park and floating in the water in some of the attractions.Most of the park had potholes, not easy to walk around in the dark.Scaled down parades. : (Fireworks at close together with graphics and lasers were great.In all a trip to Alton Towers would have been better and cheaper!",Disneyland_Paris,137

The lack of beautiful landscaping (except at the entrance) was also a disappointment. I did like their version of the Haunted Mansion and the clothing stores on Main Street were nice. Overall, you get the impression the park isn't finished or they ran out of money and had to make due with faux decorations like plastic wall murals rather than real wooden structures. I think I'm a bit spoiled by the original Disneyland but would advise parents to check out the rides and what is offered carefully before purchasing those expensive tickets.

Plenty to do and 2 parades later we had seen most of the park. Came back on day 2 to see the rest and go on our favourite rides. Plenty of walking to be done and some waiting in line at times. Everything is very over the top as you would expect froma theme park of this type and it brings out the child in all of us.

I know people will always say it is too crowded but that is usually when people go during the peak of tourist season (summer, Christmas time, New Years etc.) or whenever there's a school break. Even if you are a tourist and have a couple of kids, just take them out of school for a couple days (I recommend on a Monday Tuesday) during the slow season and you will have a much better experience.

Rides for the larger attractions were long still as well, but there were plenty of rides with less than a 20 minute wait as well.It was my 6 year old daughters first trip there, and we took here 5 year old cousin as well.

Chips, cookies, candies were okay. Drinks were also allowed. My tip is to buy water outside before going there as the price inside is much higher. Enjoy the day and wait until 7:30pm for the Grand Parade, It was worth the wait.

They have a way of making their guests feel like it's their first visit ever.The 60th anniversary decorations and merchandising was lovely. If you go, make sure you stay for the Paint the Night parade   well worth it.Be warned, the park has no wifi (unlike Disneyworld), which is good to know if you're travelling from afar. One word of warning: if you want to go on the Peter Pan ride, be prepared for wait. 45 minutes at its slowest. Perhaps they should consider a FastPass for Peter Pan :)",Disneyland_California,130

Now I not saying that all of the food is bad but the hamburgers can stand improvment and why did they take away the stand that sold Mc Donalds fries?

The best rides are the big grizzly mountain mine, and mystic manor. Food is expensive.

Then watch people that rent wheelchairs and scooters skip the lines with their 10  member families, so they don't have to wait in lines. That's frustrating and disappointing that Disney doesn't limit that. The staff.... goodness Disney...grumpy staff complaining together constantly is ridiculous.... STAFF....shush and do your complaining AWAY from those of us visiting the  Happiest Place on Earth .

We didn't get to go on any other rides because my husband fell and broke his foot in Toontown. We had to wait for a nurse to look at it and wait for a wheelchair before going to the emergency room at a nearby hospital anyway.

I was able to go there without and with the crowd, and what a difference it makes. So if you can avoid holidays and weekends, you will have a blast. So many rides and attractions you will need more than 1 day to do everything you wanted. Food is expensive though, but you can bring yours. Especially with little ones I really recommend bringing lots of snacks, food, beverages, etc. Or you can always leave the park, eat decent lunch outside and come back, but then you are spending time outside of the park, which is a bummer.Parking is about 15$   plenty of parking though.",Disneyland_California,128

With increase in price, you would expect the value to go up in regards to one's experience, but not in Disney. Seems like their objective is to let way too many people in the park that you would be lucky, if you could even experience 4 or 5 rides.

We went mid week so it was relatively easy to get around and usually 20 30 mins waiting time max. for rides. Monorail was the longest waiting time and not worth it (in our opinion).

For sure be prepared, it's not a cheap place, but once paid, all attractions are free. Food is ok, you don't really go there for a top dinner, and the entertainment (parades, theatre, shows, meet and greet etc is world class. It's also a great place for adults.

Do not bring selfie sticks  monopod: A lady there politely told me to keep my stick because it's not allowed inside...so i did..but unfortunately, there are some..only some locals using that...lol2. Foods and drinks are not allowed inside. You need to buy foods and drinks there so better bring a lot of money coz the price inside is really DOUBLED! Don't forget to try their MICKEY PANCAKE, it tastes very very good! 3. Be patient on the ques..almost every ride takes 30 40minutes waiting time. :)4. Provide an entire day for Disneyland.

This was definately the most reasonable option and the station is right beside the entrance to Disneyland. Unknown to us, however, the trains were on strike which left us stranded in the centre of Paris. We then had to take a private taxi which was 80   . The trains were still on strike for our return journey so we had to book a private shuttle. We booked this using Paris Shuttle Service.

We usually grab a bite to eat maybe do a little shopping and two to three or maybe four rides. Always great fun time but just be prepared to wait sometimes.

Staying at the hotel and day passes allowed us to spend a series of 1 2 days in the park which balanced it out more. Overall good but zero perks for DVM members who get alot in the USA.,Disneyland_HongKong,139

Everyone was singing, dancing and waving with the characters! The energy and spirits of everyone is high! And who doesn't love the fireworks display!The rides are amazing and it caters for all.Kudos to be given to all staffs in Disneyland Hong Kong! I cannot imagine how the staffs handled the teeming excited crowds of people everyday. And as we stayed till the closing hour, we noticed how efficient the cleaners cleaned the areas, the bins and restrooms! It had been thoroughly cleaned and freshen up when we used the restroom before taking the MTR back to our hotel. ",Disneyland_HongKong,125

How that can be resolved is a mystery. But it is a fact. Too few rides have Fast pass opportunities, and some of the more popular ones have you returning 3 4 hrs later. Waiting an hour for Peter Pan's flight, only to have it be over in a couple minutes, was truly disappointing. My biggest complaints is that there is no wifi in the park. The Disneyland app would be a great tool if accessible. But given the number of out of state and country visitors, I would think Disneyland could offer wifi (as Universal does). Still... a fun time but expensive and crowded.",Disneyland_California,133

My 2 kids enjoyed themselves so much each time that they are never ready to come home. I have found each time that the grounds are well kept, and the cast members are all very helpful and knowledgeable. The bathrooms are usually clean and well kept. The rides are great. My kids really love the Grizzly River Run in DCA. Things, especially food, are quite pricey, but it's Disneyland, so what else can you expect. My husband & I really love to see the kids have a great time when we visit Disney. Just go and you won't be disappointed. We are planning another trip soon, can't wait!!",Disneyland_California,136

Arriving by car you get the pleasure of paying $20 for parking that between the wait getting in the parking structure and fighting the crowd to get in a team takes at least an hour. Most rides take near to an hour to wait or get a fast pass and come back in 2 hours or more. While waiting for the fast pass you can   t get another. If you manage to get on a ride it lasts about 5 minutes. Spend a day there and maybe get on 4 or 5 rides. Not worth the money or time unless you   ve never been there and even then not sure it is.,Disneyland_California,129

Well, the longest queues you will ever stand for, losing your time. Oh and then the dirt on the floor, I will not even go into details, because it is quite disgusting to be honest. The overpopulation in the park and the mass of people make the trip unbareable to be honest. The huge dissappointed and specially when you know Disney Paris, Florida or California... So one good advise. Do not settle for less. Go to the real Disney, dont settle for the mediocre one just because it is nearer......Dont do that to your kids. ",Disneyland_HongKong,128

The park is very similar in size and number of attractions to The Magic Kingdom and we all agreed that while most of the attractions were very similar to their Magic Kingdom counterparts, several, including Pirates of the Caribbean, The Haunted House, It's a Small World and Space Mountain, were slightly better at the Paris park. We found all of the workers within the park to be friendly and many spoke English very well. The lines were short and everything was well organized. The food was average for a theme park, but there were plenty of options to suit various tastes. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our day in the park.",Disneyland_Paris,136

I absolutely loved ever second I spent here and we booked to go back as soon as we got home.The only thing I found frustrating about DLP was people smoking. It has been made an actual thing that you can't actually smoke around the parks, which is great, and they created special places to go if you wanted to smoke. It was nice but then all of a sudden despite the rule, you would walk past and into people smoking and no regard around kids, this really annoyed me, but I'm sure it is very hard to police.

If you are their for several days take a trip to Val d'europe the Primark has a disney section and has similar gifts at half the price.I last went as a child and back then some many years ago, the characters wandered around. Now you can only see them, in shows, parades, meet and greets or paying for meals with them. This definately disappointed me as the characters are as much the magic.",Disneyland_Paris,121

I prefer the WDW prebooking of fastpasses and the magic bands to manage long lines and waits, but you can add MaxPass if you want to pay for it. Park is clean and well themed. All the CMs are friendly and accommodating. Tried Walt   s chilli. Didn   t get to ride in the front of the monorail but we tried. Having park hopper is nice between these two parks as they are so close together. A few rides went down a couple times but never for long.

It was their first plane trip, first time to see an ocean and first time Disney. It was amazing, seeing Disneyland through a child's eyes. They wanted to ride every ride they saw and even with a fear of heights, we rode Disney's version of the Ferris Wheel (of course the one that rocks), Tower of Terror (which the 6 year old said he would never ride again) and various other rides. The only down side (other than the expense) was that the new Cars attraction was not yet opened, it opens this summer. We had a great time   Thanks Mickey!!!!",Disneyland_California,123

I'd say this park is best suited for younger children as the rides are all rather tame and everything appears to be tailored for this age group.The parade was great although it would have been nice to see some of the older Disney characters  the whole park seems to focus on the more recent Disney creations.The 'Dreams' firework, fountain and light display shouldn't be missed!!The prices are rather steep but this was expected.The only really disappointing thing was the attitude of the staff.

There is lots of little food stalls dotted around and it   s spaced out well, you can spend the whole day there. Didn   t spend longer than half an hour for the rides. If you do 1 ride then definitely do the studio tram tour and hotel tower of terror (both at universal).They do a Halloween themed parade at 12pm and 5pm is the main character parade. It was brilliant. The fireworks start around 8.30 9ish. It was the best thing I   ve ever seen. Just be careful with any bags as there is thousands of people. ",Disneyland_Paris,122

There are stores and attractions lining both sides of the streets. You can see Abe Lincoln, and watch six early Disney cartoons in a theater. There are all of the old favorites, Matterhorn, Space Mountain, the Haunted House, Pirates of the Carribean, Thunder Mountain, and some new rides like Indiana Jones.Each area is themed, and nobody does atmosphere like Disney. It's best to use Maxpass. This is an app used with your phone that you can use to make fastpass reservations. It's $10 per ticket per day, but well worth it. You can have more than one fastpass at a time with maxpass, and you don't have to be at the ride to reserve a time. ",Disneyland_California,139

The food was reasonable in quality, although nothing special.The worst however was that the toilets were overly dirty. Having so many mainland Chinese visitors, park management should know that mainland Chinese men do not bother to lift the toilet seat before leaking, and that they have some sort of spreading device attached, distributing the urine evenly everywhere (outside the toilet). The toilets there are simply disgusting, without exception. Some additional cleaning staff would do wonders for sure. been there done that, I see no reason to go back unless my son nags me too much about it.",Disneyland_HongKong,140

The rest is a big  commercial  queue   in restaurant, attractions, etc. Even the idea of easy pass, intended for the earlier access of Disney's Hotel guests to the park, is turned upside down   the several parts of park and most of attractions are open not from 8 a.m (as declared), but as of park normal opening hours   10 a.m. Needless to say, that to make waiting time more attractive the big screens with attraction related cartoons and short films could be installed. Also the famous French bureaucracy for the EH&S doesn't speed up the queue...   in general a lot of areas of improvement in order to make customers happy",Disneyland_Paris,124

We brought water bootes with us so we saved some money there but we ate at the park but the options were not the best we had 2 sandwiches which were not good and a bottle water and the bill came to $30 but it is expected however that did not leave a sour taste cause the park was really clean overall the experience was the best i could have imagined but going to the park was a headace it was so packed with traffic so leave early,Disneyland_California,124

Park itself is still very clean. There were queues for rides but these went down quickly.

I had read the other reviews that were posted about them the night before we left and was dreading the thoughts of them not turning up.

It is large not as large as World but it is perfect in all ways for what it is, an escape into the world of Disney. They are one of the few companies that still care about the details, and seem to go to great lengths to enhance everyones experiences. It is catered to you, buy an annual pass if you live in California, or somewhere in commutable distance.

The lights and firework show was brilliant, even though we had to stand a long way back. We got to do every ride we wanted to do; we used the fast track tickets for the popular rides which allowed us to make best use of our time.

Yes the park has maintenance issues and prices are steep but if you consider that the resort still does not make a profit after  20 years you can only applaud the way they are running this special place. There are parks in Europe that make huge profits that are in worse shape or deliver a lackluster experience at best in comparison to this gem of a park.

With small children it's hard to explain that we would have to wait 2 hours for a 30 second ride that really doesn't do much is a tricky thing. You know it's bad when you have to wait 20 minutes to get what is the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted and put in the bin after a few sips For the money we paid we could of stay at splash landings in Alton towers for a whole week and had a much better time. ,Disneyland_Paris,121

As I speak Mandarin they would be full of apologies once they realised we understood what was going on...still not acceptable. Racism is never a good thing, and being on the wrong end of it is abysmal. The rides are all up to Disney's standards and the queues weren't too long.

Most of them are smoking around their their own poor children, however it did spoil the Disney magic.The toilets stink, doesn't matter what time of day either. Many rides were out of action and unfortunately Disney didn't tell me this when I booked.

Get your tickets online from Disney web site, that is the best deal you can get. Notice that you can NOT use the tickets on the same day you buy them, so buy them at least 48 hours before your planed visit day.  You need at least 4 days to cover all rides in both parks.

Do the babies really enjoy the park? It is a magical place and the crowds over the years have gotten much bigger and ruder. But we will always go back, as long as we can still get around!

Just make sure you don't let the late arrivals push in at the last minute and spoil you kids viewing! Princess Pavillion was excellent for my daughter although the system of queuing for 90 mins or more just to get a time slot at 10.30am and then queuing for another hour was a chore.

We did the park in 2 days this time and still of course didnt see everything, but I have to say we really didn't have very long waits in lines on the Monday and Tuesday we were there, we took advantage of the Extra Magic hour on Tuesday and had several rides done before 9am (park opened at 7 that day for the extra hour ) As always, I loved my time at Disneyland and hope to go back again soon!",Disneyland_California,133

In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee.

Otherwise, the place is beautiful, food is great, costly of course. The 4D effect in theatre experience of Iron Man was well created. But the post sunset fireworks were an absolute visual delight and you need to stay back till 7:30 pm to make your visit feel complete. Easy to commute to Disneyland by MTR: East Tsim Sha Tsui         Nam Cheong         Sunny Bay         Disneyland.

394869335,1,2016-7,United States,"Disneyland Park have sectioned off viewing areas for the privileged. These sections are not open up to guests even if they are not filled. Way to make your guests feel welcome Mickey.In addition to selfie sticks, many things are banned. You are forced to take it back to your car or donate it to goodwill. If you have a kid who wants to have fun with a non Disney approved bubble blower, security may screams at your kid and force you to throw the toy away or take it to your car. It is very sad to see. The little boy did not understand why he was screamed at.Follow all rules and be prepared to wait and wait and wait for your happiness and hold on to your hunger, you poor, unfortunate souls.

621662561,5,2018-9,Australia,"Spent 2 days at the park. Didn   t have to queue up for any rides as I am guessing it was off peak season. It was very hot though so I would probably recommend going during the cooler months, but then you might have to queue up for rides. Because of the typhoon there were a few rides that were closed. Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too. Only took our 1yr old on the    It   s A Small World    ride but my 9yr old nephew went on pretty much all the rides. Spent heaps on merchandise too! Would definitely want to go again!",Disneyland_HongKong,120
621103524,4,2018-9,United Kingdom,"Disneyland is simply magical. The park is desperate into different lands with the castle as the centre focus point, which helps you to orientate yourself so you can easily navigate. There are plenty of rides and activities for all ages: my young daughter particularly enjoyed the teacups and    it   s a small world   . I highly reccomed downloading the app before traveling as it gives you showtimes and lets you know the wait times for rides. The Peter Pan and Snow White rides have particularly long queues and are probably best avoided unless they   re your favourite characters. Stay for the fireworks which are simply breathtaking. The food leaves a lot to be desired as most vendors only sell fast food; if you   re particularly health conscious, it   s best to take healthy snacks with you.",Disneyland_Paris,136

We had purchased a ticket for both, Disneyland park and Walt Disney Studio and it was worth to see both. Both sides have activity to choose from for different ages. Our favourite in Disney park is the Star wars ride. It is definitely the best ride in the park although if you have motion sickness, this is definitely not for you.  We have the skip  the  line ticket and some rides have a fast pass but at this time we didn't need it as it's not as crowded as we though. I say it was a great visit and definitely worth it.",Disneyland_Paris,124

It lets me feel like a kid again. My only complaint is the lack of structure with the character schedules. Except for a few certain characters like Minnie and Mickey and a few select princesses, most characters tend to just pop up in certain locations. You never know when they will be there and how long they will stay to do pictures. I like everything organized and I love getting character pictures, so this is especially frustrating for me. But any trip to Disney is fantastic for me. I am already planning next year's vacation!",Disneyland_California,122
123966316,5,2011-3,United States,"I just love it here. Suggest you go for at least 3 days. Get to the park right at opening, take advantage of all the big rides early in the morning, because its mostly young kids that early so those lines don't fill up until earlier. I suggest seeing any parades or shows the first day you are there, then during those times the following days hit the rides. The little stand at the end of main street has the best corn dogs! and I just love a place where you can buy pineapple spears to snack on. Fantasmic it the best show there is. Also, make the adventure even more fun by searching for the hidden mickey's on each ride, its harder than you think!",Disneyland_California,126

Also got to see a sneak peek of the new Ironman Experience coming soon. Favorite rides....Hyperspace Mountain, Ironman, Toy Story RC Racer and Parachute Drop, Big Grizzly Mtn Runaway Mine Cars.

Unfortunately the new ride Rataouille was having lots of trouble and kept breaking down, teething problems? I don't know but it happened every day and queuing for 1.5 hours only to be turned away is frustrating. It is an amazing ride though! A top tip if you don't mind being split up is to go single rider for certain rides it really does drop the waiting time down significantly advisable for Crush coaster and Rataouille . The staff were also in need of a bit of Disney training there were the exceptions however.",Disneyland_Paris,122

The rides are just super great and although lining up can be a little tedious, It   s just so worth it. I would recommend getting a fast pass for your favourite ride but not all of the rides, It will work out to be very expensive if you do this. Take your time to walk around. Plenty of places to grab a cold drink or a bite to eat. A definite to stay for the fireworks. Just a magical place to be.

Despite this, I've been to Disneyland several times & whilst never overawed this trip just failed miserably.The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one was for the quality of the firework display   very good   just not good enough to convince me to return with the family anytime soon.

Queues were huge. Like 1 hour for most rides. Some were broken down and some being refurbished which was a shame. Food and drink was rediculous where price is concerned. 2 beers 1 coke and a toastie was 23 euro. Take your own food and drink it will save you a lot. Ponchos were 10 euro. The place is clean, staff are helpful. A lot of armed guards on the entrance which was reassuring also scanners etc for bags. You also have to pay 20 euro to park which is a rip off. I gave 4 star though as the kids loved it. Aged 2 and 7. ",Disneyland_Paris,136

I have been several times over the years and the park is always incredibly well kept and the customer service is always excellent. It's Disneyland, so don't be surprised if there are long, crowded lines. If you can't deal with an excess amount of people this isn't the place for you. Most bad reviews are from clueless people who don't understand what a trip to Disney entails. There are slower times that can be found by searching the Internet for crowd charts. At some slower times I find it almost too slow, so for those who hate crowds it should be fine as long as you plan around the crowds. Can't wait for Star Wars land!",Disneyland_California,123

We had never been before, and will never go again!!!! We queued for 3 hours for crushes coaster and the mine train and they weren't even the longest queues in the park. Far to busy, they should limit the amount of tickets sold. I thought that the characters would be walking around the park but no, that's another thing you had to queue for (about 20 30 mins) for a photo. Its really not fair on the children, what a waste of money! I can safely say that its not a magical experience and more of a money making machine.",Disneyland_Paris,121

Had to walk a lot so ones whos going to paris one be prepared, and don't take Disney train it's rubbish. Takes ages for the next train to come and stops for very long time. Anyway Disney has two parks so buy the ticket of all two parks it's amazing. One is Disneyland and second is walt Disney studio. In Disneyland you shouldn't miss the parade and the disney dreams show starts at 11pm. There are many good rides in the Disneyland such as space mountain, thunder mountain, pirates of the carrabean ride and many more. In Walt disney studios the best rides are rocknroller coaster, crush coaster and Hollywood tower hotel. Overall the disney park is awesome",Disneyland_Paris,137

The also seem to have more detail put in to the sets etc.The food was really good, especially the restaurant near Indiana Jones ride. It can be expensive to eat in the park so I would advise going to the train station at the entrance first and getting sandwiches etc from thereMost of the rollercoasters go upside down.I unfortunately speak little french but it was super easy to communicate with staff.Crush's Coaster was the best; it had the longest queues so I would recommend going on it as a single rider.

My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well.",Disneyland_HongKong,125

It is so energizing seeing the park all decked out with holiday decorations, Christmas trees and even a special holiday parade! They even gut a few of the rides and make it all a huge Christmas theme inside, it was really amazing to see! The Haunted Mansion and a Small World were the most decked out rides, really gets you into the Christmas Spirit. We are so glad we went during this time of the year, what a great Christmas bonus!

Disneyland however is built in such a nicely compact manner that we were able to go to Disneyland, California Adventure, and still have time to shop and eat at Downtown Disney. The parks are quite walkable. Rides are great   The Disney experience is always a happy one. The pier at California Adventure is a throwback experience to more intimate fair experiences.

Dumbo, tea cups, it's a small world, finding memo submarine, and even pirates of the Caribbean were all good rides for him. We didn't get a chance to do the Tiki Room or Jungle Cruise but will do that next time! We were worried he would be scared of the characters but he was not, he wanted to hug all of them!

One of the ride made us queue for about 40 minutes and we spent less than 5 minutes onboard. Others takes about 20 mins give or take. Queue to meet the characters wasn't so bad. Halal restaurants are available in the park. The Mickey waffle is definitely a must try. I should say they taste just nice as a Parisian crepe. We arrived at 12 noon and did not manage to cover most rides. However we did stay for the ending fireworks and it was spectacular. Dont miss that one!,Disneyland_HongKong,123

We chose to go on Sunday, and the crowds were much less than the day before when our son went. Even with many attractions closed for maintenance and updating for the upcoming Diamond Anniversary, we still managed to visit our favorite rides and could move about without too much crowding. If you are there and get a craving for a corn dog, the Red Wagon is at the end of Main Street going towards the castle, on the right, tucked back in a corner by the medical station. Great corn dogs, and you can get chips and a drink there too! It satisfied the end of the day hunger munchies!",Disneyland_California,137

One zone comprises of a lot of amusements, so I think anyone would not leave a zone in less than 1,5 hours. Merchandise shops and food courts are everywhere. Don't forget to experience Philharmagic show and the rollercoasters. Make sure you watch the firework (by the time I arrived, I failed to catch the firework due to bad weather, all day). The food: If you could stand not eating all day, it would be good, because the foods are quite expensive (if we compare the price and the delicacy).

My son has autism and the green card from city hall was a blessing. We just had to take proof of his disability. So he didn't queue for any rides and there were specialised areas for the parades so it wasn't overwhelming for him.

To eat within the park was expensive but this is the case in al;l therme parks. The parade was excellent and I really liked the way the cast interacted with the children encouraging them to dance with Mickey and Minnie. I especially enjoyed  It's a Small Small World  this alone was well worth the entrance fee. There were lots of rides to cater for all ages plus a star studed musical.

Every single employee was friendly, kind, knowledgeable and professional at the same time. The park was spotless inside and out. It might be old, but they keep it up beautifully. The fireworks at night were absolutely gorgeous and perfectly synchronized with the overwhelmingly beautiful music. They had animations shadowing on the front of the castle and down both sides of Main Street on the store fronts that went with the music themes. I had tears in my eyes the whole time remembering raising my kids with these movies and music! The gardening, decorations and visuals were all out of this world.

I really enjoyed how accessible the Disney Characters were   you didn't need a fast pass to get a picture with them like you do down in Florida. I was slightly disappointed at the castle which is still the focal point when you walk down Main Street but not nearly as awesome as the other park. Wait times were very doable. I think the longest wait time for a ride was 90 minutes. The teenagers enjoyed Adventure Park more than Disneyland, which is geared for the younger kids. Would I go back?

Although good this time, I wouldn't recommend it presently as it would seem 15% is closed due to building Star Wars area and many rides were also closed for renovation. The queues were incredible and most of our time there was spent waiting in lines. Bit frustrating when we'd saved over 2 years to get there, and trust me, it isn't cheap. We even made sure we went during the week but it doesn't make any difference. No fireworks due to wind, so we unfortunately missed that.

Longest wait time we had was 15 mins and many rides were less than 5 mins.Big change from Anaheim! I expect it would be busier on weekends as it was mon to thurs.The downside was several food outlets were closed which left less choice but let's face it, you don't go to Disney for food!

Expensive merchandise (as expected) but otherwise a really great day. Even with a lot of people the queues weren't too long. They are very good at entertaining you as you stand in line. It's very professional and runs smoothly. Lost my phone on the first ride and the helpful and friendly staff quickly found it for me. Our 7 year old said she had the best day of her life!

Using the Disneyland app was really useful as we were able to see which rides we wouldn't have to wait long for. Near the entrance there is wheelchair and buggy hire at 20    for the day but it's not very well sign posted. All the staff at Disney were very helpful and welcoming and we're all able to help us as our French is rather pitiful! The Disney Parade was about 5:30pm and that was definitely worth waiting to see.

Soaring over California is still a great experience, Toy Story was great but being new the lines were long.The new Ariel ride was enjoyed by the granddaughter (5) and Dumbo is still a favorite. The Matterhorn ride was fun as was the Christmas themed Haunted House and Finding Nemo .the submarine ride.Don't go at holiday time the parks were overcrowded and most of the waiting times were over 90 minutes.

Such a pleasure to go to a place that serves thousands of people on any given day and everything is so clean. They have a large staff and it shows. While expensive to get in, you can see where the money goes. Great rides, colorful walkways and paths. Decent food and lovely places to sit and relax here and there. The long lines to get on the more popular rides is the only downside. Lines are definitely too long and waiting in the sun is just exhausting at times. I wind up having to skip some of the rides because of the long lines, which is irritating. Even so, I truly enjoy visiting Disneyland and California Adventure and Downtown Disney.",Disneyland_California,134

Fast pass was complementary for 3 rides so that was good. Generally pretty clean as well. 1 star: The general train service was pretty slow. Should be able to operate much faster and less wait time.Souvenir shop wait at emporium was really long. Had about 11 customers waiting and only 2 cashiers and 1 cashier was checking out 6 bags of goods for a customer. More fast pass options would be nice to save everyone   s time overall.All in all was good. Recommend for kids and will be back next time we are in Hong Kong ",Disneyland_HongKong,121

My kids enjoyed most of the rides as they are the same as in US and Japan. If you had visited other Disneyland or Disney world, I don't recommend this.

The park offer badges (my friend had a birthday one and myself a first timer badge) Despite the incredibly pricey entrance fee ($135), it did feel worth it! The food places weren't too bad considering where you are!

My son had a great time being this was his first time to Disneyland so he didn't know any different, but in the future I will try to find out what rides are closed before we travel. The staff are all friendly and good with children and very organized. This park is by far the cleanest park I've ever seen. They take a lot of pride in keeping it very clean and it shows.

I loved everything   creativeness, design, layout, exlellent state of maintenance, convinience of everything, starting from special shaded routes for queues (the Chateau de Versailles should have one!) and ending with sufficient amount of benches.

The park is full of merchandise shops with overpriced souvenirs. For kids of age over 10 years, the park offers amusement for 15 minutes   what a rip off!

Its especially great for younger kids , even 4 5 year olds ( since they can sit on most rides) and it doesn't get tiresome   because the walks are shorter. What was upsetting  was that too many rides were shut down   since others were being built, the speciality restaurants also were shut down  and others were rather bland. And finally the Photo Pass was a complete waste because hardly any of the rides were having them ( except one). Shows were nice though.

I can hardly call it a great time at Disney when your daughter is walking through the rides in tears because her shoulder hurts so bad. You may think this isn't Disney's fault, but it most certainly is. A park is over sold if you can't even move without getting an injury. We will never go back until they fix this.

You can get a lot in if you are an early riser  but there will be some wait for most rides. You can get Fast Passes, but not for nearly as many rides as Disney World.

So be patient.We had halfboard at our hotel (and parks). That was convenient, because we could choose to visit restaurants and cafes at our own pace in the middle of the day, and at our own expence.The best funfairs and attractions for adult and teens are at Disney studio park, and Disneyland park is best for children.

We arrived about 1 2hr after it opened and we had about 4 1 2hrs before it started to rain. A few of the rides were kept open and only lightening made them stop completely. We stayed till the end anyway and saw the fireworks but the parade was cancelled.

Some parts of the park were closed for renovations, but even so most things seemed to be up and running. Though the parks are comparable, the feel is slightly different. Disneyland felt slightly smaller and less intimidating (maybe because of the areas that were closed, but I don  t think so), and we had surprisingly good luck with getting the fast passes and not having to wait more than 20 minutes for anything (our longest wait was for Alice in Wonderland, 20 25 minutes).

I would recommend not queuing up for the dumbo ride as it was an hour queuing and five minutes on the ride!!! The food was pleasant, I had a southern fried chicken burger and it was tasty. Although, the prices were extortionate. Teddies for    20?! Balloons for    10?! Dont go with less than 20 euros. All in all, the park was okay. It is worth it, but not often. ",Disneyland_Paris,126

I thought it was pretty boring and couldn't wait for it to end. If you are there by yourself, take advantage of the single rider lines that some rides have.

Perfect for our two girls as they are 5 and 1 so we were able to see just about everything. The staff were all super nice, helpful and very friendly.

Why on Earth would you create a designated viewing area in a place that you can't view? Ridiculous. We were furious. And when we went to ask one of the staff where we could go to see she basically recommended a walk that would leave us at Knotts Berry Farm. Oh well, their wise it is standard excellent Disney.

There isn't a huge difference just you walk less when coming out so the first day I did preferred and second day just normal. You take a tram inside and wait in line for most rides. It is of course Disney so it is great fun for the kids. The one in Hong Kong is basically a miniature version of this one so if you went there then you know the park already pretty well.

If you are staying on the resort or close by, plan to take a break mid day to refresh and beat the heat. Also, take time to speak with the cast members.

To me this trip solidified that Disney only cares about the bottom line as they clearly had too many people in the park and were unable to accommodate. I am actually ok with the high prices as I honestly expected to pay extra for the experience. What is unacceptable is the waiting for everything..as other guests mentioned you literally cue for everything. The only way to see everything is to stay for an entire week because you will literally be in line the entire time. Seems like numbers through the door are far more important than quality of experience. We are done with Disney. ,Disneyland_Paris,138
494981256,3,2017-6,United States,Long queues for rides and attractions but ok when you get on them. Helped by the fast track system which enables you to go to the ride and book a time slot later in the day when you can come back and get in faster. Of course the food and drinks are expensive but what can you expect because you have to use their concessions. We prefer the Florida Disney but came here as we were in California and this was the original. Showing its age a little now. One thing they could do to help would be to trim back some of the larger older trees   that would help visitors to better see features of the park and orientate themselves using the park plan.,Disneyland_California,125

I feel so sorry for the tourist that have saved up all their money to come to disneyland paris and can't even get to sit on THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN ride! all of the rides are really really fast! and not smooth at all. the lightings are very very bad! you can hardly see anything. too dark. the employees over there can be a bit bitter. It's sad that it's from Disney! I try not to compare to Anaheim but it is nothing if you compared to it.. but the only thing thats a big WOW out of this is the end firework show!!!! you got to watch it!! MUST SEE.

While some of the attractions are fun and the kids love them, it feels that everything is made and designed to take your money not to help you or make you feel good. Factor onto this the overcrowding of the park and you have an awful experience... Why would anyone wait 2 hours in the queue for 1 single minute of turtle ride is beyond me... I come out of three days there feeling like disney is the worst brand in the world and that the ethical etho consisting in ripping off your customers because their children are conditionned to like disney characters is completely unacceptable.

We were here just after the school holidays, and the place was still packed (still needed to line up for at least 30 minutes to an hour for rides), but not as bad as it would have been otherwise.The shows in Disneyland HK is one of it's best features, especially the Mickey Mouse symphony and the Little Mermaid 4D show (cannot exactly remember the name for this). The rides were very friend to toddlers and my son enjoyed his trip here immensely.

We had a one day park hopper, and for us, that was enough. For kids, you probably want two days, as we skipped all the kiddie rides. Doing the fast pass thing is awesome. It is free, and you can roam around instead of waiting in line. Come prepared if rain is forecasted, otherwise you'll spend 9 euros (each) on ponchos like we did. I had a great time, and Sleeping Beauty's Castle is really pretty. I didn't see as many characters as I'd hoped to, but it was pretty awesome to see Chewbacca roaming around.

Given we went in the summer the place was very busy and so learning how to use the Fastpass system and if you have young kids the Rider Switch is crucial otherwise you spend a long time in the queues.We went first thing in the morning and returned mid afternoon after a rest at lunch time meaning we could take in the great show and fireworks in the evening.If I am being really critical it is that its not on the scale of Florida but still a brilliant few days there.",Disneyland_California,132

Perfomance showed by trash bin men (percussion using their tools) definitely eye catching for visitors. Luckily the weather is very nice, and since there's a high temperature warning from Hongkong Observatory centre at that time, the park is not too crowded and you just need to queue fo 5 mins max to play.

Unfortunately there was too little of it   too many of the rides were closed for refurbishment, including 2 of the 4 big rides that were suitable for children. The other rides, such as teacups etc can be found at a Rhyl funfair and weren't worth an expensive trip to Paris. This meant that while we had booked a 2 day holiday, we had actually done pretty much everything on the first day. Some of the construction work was badly hidden, such as scaffolding on Thunder Mountain and Skull Island which really broke the atmosphere.

If you're going with family and young children, I would say this is the best Disneyland resort to go as most of the attractions are perfect for kids below 5 years old but make no mistake, it also has attractions for adult like raft and all. It was rather unfortunate that we didn't see the fireworks when we were there because we've arrived in disney resort quite early so we didnt think we could stay longer.

Stroller rental costs pretty much the same. Be on your most comfortable shoes as there will be too much walking.

I am reading reviews from the last couple days and everyone is mentioning many ride closures. I think over 4 days it happened at least 6 times that we were waiting for an attraction and it closed down. I would like to hear from Disney what is going on and how it is going to be fixed!

Even with the studio park, the old park has lots it's magic. The light parade has changed their lights and they know look cheap (where has the high standards gone), the buildings look old, the walkways, rides look tired and no new injection of enthusiasm into the park. Some of the staff are great, some good and some not so, but I understand that with such a large manpower, they can't get it all right but as Disneyland..they should.

As always everything is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful, however, the food outlets are awful, when we were there the Comet had 4 meals on offer, but could only supply 1 of them and the alternate restaurant that we found opposite had burger style meals that were not nice, the pork in my friends burger was stringy and dehydrated.

We also noticed on our last trip that it was more dirtier around the park than on previous visits from rubbish on the ground to the toilets not being maintained.

I found Stitch Encounter pretty funny, but that might vary slightly on a show to show basis as it depends on audience interaction.

I recommend skipping the afternoon parade since the one at night is more spectacular (the characters wear their costumes with glowing lights and stuff).There is a fireworks show at 8:45 pm sharp, don't miss it.

We paid more than 1K for us and 3 kids for park visit for 2 days.Waiting for each attraction is 45 minutes average. We had a baby and were asked to leave the stroller each time at the beginning of the line for attraction. And then I had to carry the baby for 45 minutes in waiting for each attraction. Bizarre and crazy experience. Never again! The attractions themself very childish and the whole experience wasn't worth the money even close. After first day my legs were finished and second day was a complete suffer.Never again we'll go to Disneyland. They even didn't have the option to buy front in line pass like Universal studios have.

With all the pulling pushing shoving stampeding during night shows, I don't think its a good place to bring infants in strollers ( and running the wheels up everyone's feet to make way in the crowd.

The parade is great as is the illuminations which is at park closing time. We only saw each once whilst we were there as it gets very busy and we didn't feel we needed to see them more than once.

Also expect to pay more for food with in the park but sometimes even $5 for a Mickey ice cream sandwich is worth it. I do recommend park hopper tickets so you can experience California Adventure as well. Most of the park can be seen in 2 days but it requires a lot of time on your feet.

It is about the price of a 7 day pass and it gives you at least a 10% discount on pretty much anything Disney.

It was all we had hoped for it to be and much more.Key highlight were the parades   they were amazingly beautiful. so was the day end fire cracker show.however, one negative observation   everything in the park is freakishly expensive. while a 2 day pass for disneyland costs around 600HKD, one simple print out of a photogrpah taken by their photgraphers costs 168HKD!!!!....... what the hell are they thinking ??saving grace was that for all character meet n greets, they allow us to use our cameras too : )",Disneyland_HongKong,125

Disney is great, don;t let anyone tell you otherwise and on a single trip it would be a 5 star review. after the 3rd trip you start to see the cracks, still an amazing place every child should visit in their lifetime, annual pass give you free parking and money off food, drink, shops and any other extra.top tip: go to the studio park fish and get fast pass ticket for Ratatouille as it gets very busy very quickly, they also have a single rider line which is quick too. the reason for this is that they have no photographs to sell you after the ride",Disneyland_Paris,130

We made the best of our time there but we found the magic was lacking mainly due to the lack of characters walking the parks. Having visited Disney world in Orlando we were expecting to see a lot of characters walking the parks. We got the impression that the powers that be in Disney wanted us to spend time with the characters in the themed restaurant where we would be spending a premium price. All the staff on the rides were extremely helpful and polite unfortunately I cannot say that for the staff in the a large number of restaurants there. Every restaurant we were paying a premium price for a very poor product. Would we go back again, sadly the answer is no!",Disneyland_Paris,134

It's my favorite place on earth, where I am reconnected with the child in me I purchased the tickets online which is highly recommended to avoid long waiting lines and sometimes to benefit from special offers they have When u enter the park, u feel like you have entered a Magical Land, this feeling is immersed with the music played in the background.The parade at 05:00 pm was amazing, you would feel like you are 5 years old again. Other than all of those adventure and adrenaline rides I highly recommend to ride  Small World  . It's very charming and delightful If you have time, it's better to get the 2 days ticket than the 1 day so you wouldn't feel rushed ",Disneyland_Paris,131

Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats.

Yes, prices are extortion for gifts food drink and yes, there a long queues for rides and character meets... What do people expect when visiting one of the biggest attractions in the world?!? Can't compare to Disney USA as I have never been, but perfect to have a European version to help those like me who will probably never be able to afford the trip to USA.

But without a doubt the best thing about HK Disney is Mystic Manor! We thought it was going to be something like Haunted Mansion. But not at all. It is its own attraction that is absolutely amazing.

My first impressions were it's quite small .. but not small enough to jam pack it full of $75 pp people !! Once you understand what is overwhelming about the park   5:1 ratio of Disney Shops to buy your memorabilia because you got cheesed off waiting in 45 60 minute queues for just a 1 minute ride.Obviously the people who run the park don't hire parents   as nobody was accommodating. Why do people work in Tourism if they hate Tourists. Now   the ultimate Plus .. Being Pregnant means you get to go to the front of the lines ... nobody told us this before hand ..

I would say everything GREAT (except the safari ride at animal kingdom) built in 4 parks at Disney World are found in two theme parks ar Disneyland, plus some other great ride found only at Disney Paris, and Disney Tokyo!!!

I recommend to go early 8am (it opens most days) as it gets so busy the lines to the rides can be so long and wait times can be hours so if you can afford it definitely pay the extra for the fast pass tickets then you will get to go on most of the rides in one day. I stayed to see the parade at 430pm and then the night parade at 845pm they are different so worth it for sure.The fireworks are on at 930pm everything is just perfection.

We were so disappointed this time with the amount of trash and food laying around. Rides were continuously breaking. The crowds were horrible. The food, which I thought used to be good, was awful. We tried several meals and none of them were good. Overall, very disappointed with Disneyland this trip. We spent almost $2000 for 3 days. Too expensive and the young people working at Disney don't seem to care as much as employees used to years ago. Also, I always remember employees being happy, almost to the point of being too happy. This time there were many unhappy employees. Not an enjoyable experience. ",Disneyland_California,134

They even close the line at some point, because too many people are waiting. I got the Fastpass at 10:30 in the morning and our return time was 8:45 p.m. Also, park in the Toy Story lot on Harbor Blvd. It is much less hectic, and so much easier to get out of at the end of the day.

Granted it is the smallest, and may not have the complete experience of the original; but for children aged from 3 15, it is just fine.Firstly, the location, on Lantau Island, is very easy to reach, via the MTR.Secondly, the lack of queues is amazing. We had a 5 minute wait for Space Mountain. Even at the peak of the day, the wait time was no longer than 30 minutes.

It can be hot in the warmer months with the humidity reaching boiling point but there are plenty of areas to escape the heat if you feel inclined.

What a mistake that turned out to be. Along with a few hundred thousand other people our 16 hour day netted 4 rides total...yes FOUR for the whole day. The crowds were so brutal, navigating with 2 small children and our somewhat slow adult son with a developmental disability was nothing short of a bad dream!

I don't freak out with crowds, but this was ridiculous. I'll avoid those areas during show times in the future.But as always, staff was friendly and helpful. Food is better than expected.

Also the meal plans sound like a good idea but you spend too much time trying to book restaurants and rushing to get breakfast, you can book ahead but who knows where they will be on any day and when they will want to eat, madness!

Which was completely crazy we were there on a Monday in low season.... Normally in US you would have the most popular rides with this waiting time.. The others in average in half hour...But I guess it has to be the fact that the US parks are much bigger with more atracctions than these ones in Paris. Other thing they could improve is to offer the printed schedule of activities parades and so as the US ones.. Since it is getting darker earlier there are some areas that need some additional lamps..But it is always fun at Disney so We for sure will come back to this park :) ,Disneyland_Paris,131

171294609,5,2013-8,United States,"Although the park is older, it is maintained beautifully! We took advantage of extra magic hours since we stayed at a disney resort. We got in at 7:15am on 2 different days and were able to do a ton of rides! One day we focused on Tomorrowland and the other day on Fantasyland. The park gets very busy after lunch time so that is when we left to go back to our resort. We came one night for fireworks but it was so busy we didn't stay long. We saw characters when we first entered the park but I didn't see many in the park. This was my only disappointment. At Magic Kingdom in Florida, I seemed to see more characters in the lands but maybe it was the times we were in the park.",Disneyland_California,135

There aren't many thrill rides there so it's more suitable for kids and people who don't enjoy thrill rides like myself..xD We went there on a Wednesday so the crowd was pretty ok.. We didn't have to wait for very long for every ride about 20 minutes at most. Most of the things there were pricey but I kinda expected it since it's a tourist spot.. The shop has a lot of souvenirs to choose from and we took a long time choosing what we wanted! Overall still a nice place to visit in my opinion. :)",Disneyland_HongKong,128

He was a bit disappointing that he was not tall enough for hyperspace mountain!. Im sure the next time we visit he will be able to live that dream!Our daughters favourite ride was small world, we must of rode that around 15 times in the 4 day period.The highlight for me was the firework and light show  i must admit i did cry!Make sure you make the most of fast passes to cut your waiting times!.",Disneyland_Paris,139

If you are going with small children who want to see Mickey and crew, do yourself a huge favor: book a Character Breakfast at one of the Disney hotels close by BEFORE you go into the park. Once in the park, Mickey and his friends are herded through the park by handlers that strictly regulate how many kids get to meet the character. If you do follow the characters and run to them when they stop, chances are your kid won't get the chance to meet them.Also, they try to sell you stuff every 10 feet. Toys, candy, food.... So be ready to say  no  a bunch.",Disneyland_California,123

My kids really enjoyed it which is the main thing. A few places I had researched where to eat were not open ie Buzzlight years pizza planet restaurant and Pizzeria Bella notte but we found a lovely pizza place in Frontierland called Colonel Hathis Pizza Outpost, quite reasonable and very yummy. Makes a change from all the burger places. Mcdonalds is far too busy and couldnt get a seat. Average waiting time for rides was about 35 40 mins which was not bad as it goes quicker than you think.

We jumped every line, got seats reserved at the show and our own private area to watch the parade. Our host was ever so gracious and knowlegeable, even taking photos of us while we were on the rides. We booked the tour online throught the Disney HK website which was super simple and then met our guide at the customer services area in the park. I totally recommend doing this tour, especially if your time is limited. The park is small so you could do it in one day, but with the heat why would you want to wait in the hot humid climate when you can be escorted straight on ?!",Disneyland_HongKong,138

At the Disney park based in Florida you can wait 3 hours in line! There are different rides, I like them more in Hong Kong Disney. I would HIGHLY recommend it! If you go here are the rides you should hit first.Mystic Manor: Best ride out of all of the Disneys!Space Mountain: STARWARS    You should try to do most of the rides because all of them are absolutely astonishing!NOTE: Toy Story land gets crowded when the weather is good.*Wish they had fast passes for more than 2 rides * ",Disneyland_HongKong,121

We also love California adventure and not near the crowds. We have two boys 11 & 6 and it was just the most memorable vacation we have ever had we can't wait to go back.

Only downside was that we wanted to see the fireworks which are on really late if you have children and have just come for the day (10pm). We were starting to get hungry and 90% of the restaurants were shut with just a couple of counter service places open serving the usual reheated burgers etc.. In the end we had to leave the park and get something to eat outside meaning we missed the fireworks!

A scooter makes the difference between a great time and one that is extremely physically challenging. This time I had a little snag. I was just finishing up at a conference at the Marriot. I had planned within the next half hour to go to Disneyland. Before I left I went to the bathroom. Just as the toliet self flushed, I heard something hit it. It was my scooter key. A Scooter 4U has such great customer service that they were there within an hour with a another key. And they did not charge me.

I would recommend checking with local school district for school closures before you select the day you will go. Avoid days when the schools in the area are closed. We experienced very long wait times on the Monday after Easter because the private schools were on break. I had called Disney before choosing the day. They were apparently unaware of the break because they recommended the day for us. In any event, we still had a great time and made lots of fun memories. The food was surprisingly good and reasonably priced compared to the area. We were traveling with our five kids aged 20 10. Enjoyed the roller coasters a lot.",Disneyland_California,124

But again, whether it is weekend pubic holidays or not, there will be long waiting lines due to the demand from mainland China. Fast Pass access was limited to 3 rides which I find it quite ridiculous.Food and drinks were everywhere however as expected the prices were astronomical! Good tip, bring your own bottle water and you can refill at the the drinking stations near the toilets. They charge HKD20 for a small bottle of mineral water! There were many souvenir shops and these are tourist traps and they keep reminding you to buy stuffs are over priced.Overall, a very average experience and would not go back again.",Disneyland_HongKong,138

Disneyland Park was so busy that in the end we gave up trying to get anywhere and went back to our hotel. We used the fast pass for the main rides as the queues were huge, but you have to collect the fast passes early as they quickly run out.. It is worth a visit with younger children for the Disney experience but would be far better to go out of season where possible as otherwise you will spend most of the day queuing and dodging the crowds. If you are looking to go for bigger rides and a more comprehensive Disneyland experience then Orlando will be the better option.",Disneyland_California,133

Only a few characters were walking around and Donald Duck was specially mean to the kids. To see the Princesses you had to make a queue (only 5 times a day with people left out being really mad) to make an appointent to see them. Nice. The parade is nothing like I expected from Disney. And just make it to make it worst, what terrible uniforms the staff had to wear. They made them unisex, bad for both. If you go to Paris you will find lots of better places to you.

Souvenirs all are pretty enough as for me is not too expensive even I didn't not buy much. Not encourage to bring kids that below age3 years old as it is not so convenient. Some food price is expensive but there are food with affordable price as well. Not to bring any outside food. can bring empty drinking bottle as there are water refillable nearby each of the washroom. Bring umbrella or caps and sunglasses. handicap people got priority. suggest to visit on weekday to avoid crowd.

But this trip was a trip of waiting in lines, not just your usual line but 1.5hr for Pirates of the Caribbean, and then 2 hours in line for Indiana Jones Temple of Doom. It is extremely expensive but that is Disneyland. Our food was good and relaxing we ate and listened to music near space mountain. Then the line for Space was 250 minutes, so we avoided that one until after the fireworks show. Yes we did get some fast passes but the crowds were so big  you just couldnt let go of the people you were with because there must have been at least a million people in the park.

We were there the Thurs Fri before the half marathon, so it was probably a little more crowded than the info books will tell you; we try to travel off season to avoid the crowds. Space Mountain is a blast as always, but an unexpected treat was the Raiders of the Lost Ark...we almost walked past it. Disney parks are always clean.

Having been their twice, both on relatively crowded days, we still only spent less than 6 hours there, including lunch to cover most of the popular rides and attractions. Of course we could have stayed longer if we wanted to hit every ride, but because of the relatively smaller footprint and repetitive attractions from other parks, we spent most of our time checking out those things that might be a little different. Food is not very good at all, from any of the three restaurants we tried. It is still a great place to go, but don't expect to be wowed by the experience if you are Disney veteran.

The lines were so short we missed some of the warnings and I missed that Space Mountain Mission 2 went upside down... the park was actually somewhat deserted in general which meant the longest line we had was 20 minutes, but most were under 5. Pirates of the Caribbean was better than the other 2 we've been through.The food was no where near the quality in the parks in Orlando. They tried for American food, and fell short.

Go and see the Lion King show and Stitch Encounter for great shows out of the sun ( or rain! ) for 30 mins in airconditioned auditoriums. My favourites are still Buzz Lightyears Lazer ride , an interactive ride where you shoot you targets, and the animation drawing classes where you learn easy ways to draw Disney characters.

While there   s a lot of great things my only gripes are A) Outside security act like they   re guarding the president and make it very inconvenient, defying common sense B) Food for the most part sucks, C) we were there on one of the    slowest    weekends of the year and still could barely walk because of so many people.",Disneyland_California,125

I had read lots of comments that its not very big, but really the magic kingdom HK has all the same things you get in the US only this looks newer, we went in October, the weather was brilliant and they had a special Halloween theme which was a nice change.

If you get there early in the day (preferably when it opens) then the lines are not long, the maximum wait we had throughout the day was around 30 minutes.

We waited between 15   40 mins for most rides and utilized the Fast Pass for several of the bigger rides. Leaving the park at night can become tough.

True, it tends to be crowded no matter when you go   especially on weekends   but the new Maxpass system helps level the playing field. And Disney has a way of adding additional detail or new attractions to make it worth coming back to again and again. It was nice to see the Star Wars presence increased and all of the kids who are fans getting excited about the Star Tours attraction and merchandise.

It's very easy to get there using the subway and also very affordable and safe. This was a really good month to go as the lines weren't long at all which made it even more pleasant. Some of the rides etc were close but it didn't matter. Food and cool drinks (and even water) are very pricey, you can pay up to 40 HKD for a water.

Splash Mountain probably delivers the most thrills. Lines are the only downside, but that's to be expected. One thing I notice about Disneyland is that you can walk around the park and sight see without getting bored. Every area is unique and have lots of things to do. Once it gets dark, it really does feel like you are in some magical kingdom.

Being a part of the Peter Pan story or seeing Snow White's tale unfold before you is simply marvelous. And these are just the fairy tale characters. Every section from Tomorrowland to New Orleans Square is wonderful!I strongly suggest picking up Flash passes early into your visit so you can have the best experience. It goes without saying that lines can get very, very long. I once had to wait almost two hours for Peter Pan.Staying for fireworks is a must if it's your first time, especially in the winter holiday season. The Fantasmic light show over the water can also be spectacular if you get a good viewing place.It's beautiful.",Disneyland_California,124

I most certainly would go back. It was nostalgic and truly brought forward tender memories...Was grateful to go on a cold day   was able to 'walk on ' all the rides... minimal waiting for anything! Hooray.My only request   have an 'adults night' or something... would have loved to spend more time in Toontown... but the 'stroller people' and their kids exhausted my patience. :) Good on them for taking their kids at that age! Just not my cup of tea. Feel like I missed out a bit... but that's ok.. maybe another day! I do hope to go back.,Disneyland_California,131
271149277,3,missing,Australia,"I visited for 4 days & enjoyed everything on offer. It's my 3rd disneyland after Hong Kong & LA. Whilst it delivered on many fronts there are several where I was let down. The nightly fireworks show is all lasers & imagery on water & light on fireworks. Lasts much longer than other parks but far less spectacular. At other parks I went back night after night, here one viewing sufficed. There were quite a few things closed for renovation, most notably Space Mountain & the large carousel. A disappointment for the kids. Lastly the level of service in the shops was nothing but poor. Very slow & poor performing people. If you're choosing I'd try another disneyland. I travelled from Australia & it's a long way to be let down. Average compared to others. ",Disneyland_Paris,135

So long as the lines for rides aren't in the sun, then I am ok with waiting!Tips: If you can, plan your trip for weekdays, preferably mid week. Fridays don't count as a weekday anymore. Disney is also very cool about you bringing in your own food again! So if you got wee ones or someone who is constantly hungry, bring a snack. At the very least, bring in your own water bottle (disposable or reusable) because a bottle is about $3 now. They have drinking fountains near just about every restroom, and I have never seen a line for a drinking fountain so save your $3 for a frozen banana instead, and refill your bottle there.",Disneyland_California,138

Some of the attractions are nice and having a special line for free fast tickets is very good. Aside from food being expensive (as you can expect) the park really needs refreshing. Its 2015 and still the rides are mostly for young teens and very outdated with characters of long forgotten. The other thing is the hospitality is under par with very poor English. Also seating or resting places are hard to find, no wonder people sit or ly between the flower parks etcetera. There are a lot of better attraction parks to visit!! Thats for sure. Like Europa park for instance. :)",Disneyland_Paris,130

We went when the Spring Break was essentially over 12 to 17 April and literally had no line ups at all. About the longest we waited was 10 minutes for Space Mountain which is really tame by modern standards. The Park was spotless as usual, the staff helpful and most rides working without issue. The food prices are high but not ridiculous and souvenirs not too bad either. After 4 visits over the past 20 years, it doesn't have the same zing and even the kids need a little more excitement now they are older.

Even on a weekday average lines are over 30 minutes though setting is nice and time waiting passes quickly. Getting to and from the park is quick & easy. A few rides seem very short in ride time for the length of the wait getting on.

I didn't want to wait for 65 minutes and the fast pass I got earlier in the day said to come back between 10:20 & 11pm. They actually closed at 11pm that night.

Remember to be back at Main Street at 2.55pm, sit down by the road at a good spot and await the Disney Parade!

The lines all had reasonable wait times, and there was so much to see and do  I'm not even sure we saw it all. Our 13 yr old boy had the best time. And there was lots for our little one to do. She LOVED it's a small world... And so did us adults secretly ;) Food was very limited and very average  that is why they lost a star! ",Disneyland_HongKong,127

We were there for three days and we felt that we could have explore and enjoyed the place more. Plan the rides in advance, take note of the parade timings as usually this is when the queue are very short, learn how the fast pass system works and used it to planning your day s. It does help a lot especially when there is a huge crowd   which is very normal everyday. We try to eat our meals during queue so to avoid waiting time. Also, restaurants are very expensive! We only eat in restaurant for dining with Mickey and Princesses opportunity! Staff are very friendly and value safety very highly! Superb!",Disneyland_Paris,132

All those things you hear about park visitors pushing, shoving, shouting and screaming (and not just the kids), allowing children to wee into bottles, spitting, queue cutting, etc are all true. I had small children with me, and during the parade, adults just barged in and stood right in front of them. Perhaps the very hot and humid weather has aggravated it a lot more. But the whole experience is just unpleasant. I have to give a big kudos to the cast members. They are always there to help, very professionally managing situations, and always with a smile (even in the heat!). Tokyo Disneyland is the place to go if you are planning to visit Disney soon.",Disneyland_HongKong,122

Nonetheless, the Fantasyland area looked quite old and floor was not well maintained, hence failing to give you the wow factor. Characters photo taking at the fantasyland's pavilions was difficult, staff does not promptly advise when would the characters return. We witnessed the characters leave but not the queue, and left us wondering should we exit the queue and return later as we had no idea how long we had to wait for the characters to come back. Most importantly, the experience was dampened whenever you witness people (of a particular nationality) cutting queues. This simply worsen your day. ",Disneyland_HongKong,126

Food was excellent for a theme park! Parade was fun, but too long to stand in the hot sun and heat. Hong Kong is very hot and humid.

Having been to Florida many times and disneyland paris once before I'd never visited over Christmas and it was exactly how I'd imagined it to be. Non french folk were well catered for except with disney junior live. The rides are what you'd expect, some are dated and tired looking.

149180882,4,2012-12,United States,"A bit of advice: we recently went right before Christmas with my family (9 adults and 3 children) and the best advice I can give you is to arrive a little before the park opens and use the fast pass system. We were able to ride 6 rides with very minimal wait times before lunch and snagged a fast pass for another major ride after lunch. The park jams up at around that time and lines become atrocious.Also, RELAX and enjoy it. There are tons of people and lots of waiting around so just come to terms with that before you get there.

I know poor excuse but it works. The train goes directly to the park so there is no worrying about where to switch or if there will be language barriers. It is set up a bit different than the two US parks but it is very easy to navigate and I think you can actually get to places quicker. They have all the best things you expect from Disney but they do still have the same waits you have anywhere else.

There was a plethora of characters   Fairy Godmother, Minnie, Pluto, Chip, Captain Hook, Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger, and Max Goof! We went back to Tomorrowland and met Thor and Spider Man.

The rides are out of this world and the buildings and running of the complex is perfect. The fast pass system works a treat if you plan your days well and with the hopper pass you can swap between both parks with ease. The staff were helpful and pleasant amenities great. My best rides were splash mountain. Indian jones, Matterhorn bobsled and the California screamer. The only disappointment was the closing of the mickey wheel early because of the wonder of colour show. I have no problem but closing an hour and 45 mins before was a bit off.

All 5 of us noticed the level of service and professionalism at this park was lacking. ( ages 55  23 ) Won't go again. For $155 for a one day Park hopper you should expect Disney service.

It seems like Disney management is pricing Disneyland admission out of reach for most families. Family discount tickets are almost impossible to find and even then are greatly overpriced. I don't think Walt would approve (or brother Roy either). Their pricing policy seems to be based on sheer greed. What is the most money we can suck out out of the budget of a family of four for a three day admission? (Presently about $950).

An abundance of shops to visit but not cheap if you have children in tow.Disney itself is spotless with many park employees there to clear up the slightest bit of rubbish. However, the public toilets were another story. Without exception these were all smelly, dirty and extremely unpleasant to use. What a shame that so much money is spent keeping the park looking so nice bu the 'out of sight' areas are left in such a state.",Disneyland_Paris,139

From shows to parade there are so many activities for kids and for adults there are some really good rides and shows too. Should try Indiana jones, twilight tower, big thunder mountain, crush coaster, space mountain, rock n roller coaster and moteurs stunt show! And finally disney dreams!A little booster from my side  don't be afraid of any ride because if others can do then you can definitely do it. It is much easier then what is looks. Try it at least once because you should experience everything in life! Happy holidays!",Disneyland_Paris,123

We had a stroll around the city and I have to tell you it was magnificent especially the peak, I would definitely recommend you to go there and went to Disneyland just recently and I just couldn't resist crying especially when the fireworks came off it was so amazing! It's like all of my childhood memories of Disney movies came true. It felt like they were real. The rides were amazing as well. I am that kind of person who doesn't love rides but I kind of changed my mind the moment I went on with it. It was all worth it and I was really excited because the next day we left for Hanoi, Vietnam",Disneyland_HongKong,123
214387211,4,2014-4,Australia,"Loved the new Transformers ride, but also the standards like Space Mountain, Big Thunder Railroad & Star Tours. Yes, the lines can be long & the wait even longer, but try to fastpass as soon as you arrive & then you can go off & enjoy some of the attractions that do not have the longer wait times. Food is pretty hit & miss, standard takeaway type & more costly than outside but try to limit what you eat here. We just love being in Disneyland although we could not afford to stay in one of 'their' hotels. The parades & fireworks are always good fun but expect to give way to loads of small children & there are not always places to sit & watch! But overall, it really is 'the happiest place in the world' still!",Disneyland_California,138
364806313,5,2015-12,United Kingdom,It wasn't a busy as I expected for NYE. The queues were long at times but if you timed it right it was ok. The longest I queued was 1 hour. My friends and I used the single rider lines and mostly ended up on the same rides. The queues for the main chain restaurants were really long but we found a lovely place (Ludwigs) which didn't have a long line and the food was delicious. Places like planet Hollywood had 3 hour queues. It would have been nice to see more characters walking round the park rather than in certain areas but that was a minor point. The snack bars are not expensive which you can find in some theme parks. People did start getting in place for the fireworks from about 8pm which is ridiculous. A fabulous experience. ,Disneyland_Paris,140

The park probably fits in a quarter of Magic Kingdom and it literally took my cousin and I half the day to finish the park. There are not a lot of rides and shows do not run often and frequently clashed. The only good thing about this Disneyland is that you can easily take pictures with your favorite Disney character. My day was certainly brightened when I was able to score a pic with Captain Jack Sparrow (this was when Disney was running Adventureland as Pirateland to promote Pirates III).

Having two young boys aged 5 and 10 and a 6 month baby we couldnt wait around for that long for a ride. Really rude people and really really expensive food. We had luch on the first day at pizza planet and spent   65 just on a salad 2 small pizzas and drinks. Dinner usually came to   100.

We weren't sure how many days to visit Disneyland Paris but found 2 days sufficient with young children. We did not get to visit the Studio Park but plan to do that another time.

Weekends are busy no matter what time of year so avoid these. Bring dome snacks keep kids occupied in queues. If going in winter months, prep for all weather. We had a rainy day this year and it was great   most queues 5 10 minutes. See the parade and Dreams at park closing. No 1 tip is to check the forum here before you go.

We walked & we walked & we walked some more....even though it is the smallest of all the Disney Parks. The kids really enjoyed the Mad Hatter Tea Party ride....we rode it 4 times!! Also the roller coaster in Grizzly Gulch. The fireworks at night were spectacular, and so was the evening parade. It was exciting for the kids to meet Mickey & Minnie (very long queues) and to enter the shops filled with magical stuff.

Make your character dining reservations as early as you possibly can or run the risk of missing out. I'm not kidding. Stop at City Hall and get all of the commemorative buttons that you like. They're awesome keepsakes and the pressed pennies are fun too! Eat churros, corn on the cob, popcorn, and dole whip! See the fireworks and watch Fantasmic! Take the time to look for the hidden mouse ears EVERYWHERE and use the Photo pass. They do really fun, magical touches. Stop in a moment breathe it in.

It was fun to walk around in daylight since the weather was cold. The parade was so exhilarating to watch and I took too much pictures of it.. Yipeee.. Everywhere you look at is beautiful even inside the comfort rooms lol.. It was quite sad that we did not get to explore all the rides with the limited time we had but we made it up by going to all the attractions. Finally, the fireworks display was so enchanting.

The Christmas themed parade was cool to watch, and we also enjoyed the holiday themed  small world  ride. It was a little disappointing how crowded it was   large parts of the park became one way streets, with attendants yelling at people trying to swim against the stream.Many of the rides had 100 minute wait times so we did not go on any rides after about 4pm.Finding a place to sit down while eating was also very difficult. If you are travelling with older family members, be sure to make reservations beforehand.Come early to avoid the worst of the lines!Overall we still had a good time (but 100 dollars for a ticket is quite a lot and we definitely won't return any time soon).",Disneyland_California,140

I tried accessing their online chat. That service was not available. I sent an email. I received an automatic reply indicating that someone would reply within 5 business days.

If you want to do it right, with or without kids and are trying to get the most time in possible, I would always plan a mid day break (including an hour nap) rather than trying to do it in one shot.

So, you line up for security, line up for X ray, line up at the gate to hurry to the rides and line up. Rules change without notice, such as no fast passes left or only every 2 3 hours dependent on crowds. Of course this is only after customers have paid for passes. This said, all workers are pleasant and have scripts available when customers express a concern. Smile listen and provide the script. Smile listen and same script.

We went the Monday after thanksgiving and it was pretty nice. Not to crowded. The wait times were not more then 25 minutes. The do share some of the same rides. I mainly wanted to see the holiday lights. There was a large tree right when you walked into the park and the castle was beautifully decorated. The parade was great. It started at  it's a small world  and went towards main street. The people were rude when they pushed thru you and plopped themselves on the floor in front of you without a care. But it was nice.

Disney characters are great and look after young and old alike.The only thing that spoilt the visit was seeing Brown Rats running around scavenging for food. Despite what is a very clean park they obviously have a vermin problem that they are not on top of. So I expected to see a Mouse or two (Mickey and Minnie) but ended watching out for rats when we sat down to eat and drink near the T Cups.Come on Disney you can do better to control this problem.

An awesome show. Very crowded and you need to have a fast pass for admission. Still a very nice show. I have degenerative disc disease and find it very painful to stand for a long time. I explained it to an employee and she was able to find a seat for me.

It's old and attractions hasn't been reniewed with actual technology.but don't expect to find great attractions (average 1hour waiting for 2 3minutes attraction), go to feel traditional vintage pictures and fairytale atmosphere from Disney. They should put more characters walking around the park (no seen Daisy for my daughter) to make pictures with.

There isn't as much here for a thrill ride junkie as WDW and some of the coasters are quite dated and shoogly but the atmosphere is pure Disney magic. I would recommend paying extra for the max pass fast pass, it saved us a lot of running around. Dress comfortable and come armed with a game plan if you want to have an enjoyable day.

I think you have to spend 2 full days or so to be able to explore everything..staff were nice and friendly...find the entrance fee a bit expensive and i hope they will make it more reasonable so you can come back the next day to see everything..,Disneyland_HongKong,140

Certainly, it is a wonderful place for my kids as they love to visit Disneyland whenever we visit HKG.However, with the increasing arrival of Tourists from mainland China   it can be really frustrating. Mainly because many of them don't like to follow the line. During the recent school holiday   my family visited Disneyland again and more than a dozen times   they just tried to go in front of us without following the line and I have to literally stop some of them.Sadly, many of the staffs ignore it.

Disney park was beautifully kept, very clean and grounds well maintained. Drink and food very pricey so take in some snacks and keep your water bottles filled up by the water fountains.The parade definitely worth getting a good view at the front, and the Disney dreams show with fireworks well worth seeing although very late for the little kids, didn't start until 2300hrs when it went dark.Queues were approx 1hour for the most popular rides, but I suppose this was at peak times.All in all a great time, would recommend to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris,136

Spotlessly clean and the shows were amazing, also queuing wasn't too bad at this time of year, max 30   40 minutes for the most popular rides. The reason I did not give 5 stars is that rides would break down often. Every day we were at the park we were on at least 2 or 3 rides that stopped at some point. My daughter didn't mind but by the 3rd day I was beginning to tire of it.

It was record heat the last 2 days of my visit, and the staff offered free ice water to everyone to help us stay hydrated. Yes the lines are long, but do your research and use Fastpass when available. I go as an adult with only adults and still find Disneyland to be a joy and a magical experience.

Please note that during the autumn period some rides are closed for maintenance. Despite that it was a lot of fun, especially with the Hollywood Tower Hotel within the Park area.

To be fair, I live close to Disneyworld so it's not like we haven't done Disney, but we had a grandiose idea of visiting all of the Disney parks as we absolutely love them. There are some different rides here which is nice but it lacks the Disney 'Magic', as the staff at the park can be rude or gruff depending on who you talk to. This is not truly a 'Disney' park, as they pay for the licensing but it is not the same Disney thus not the same experience so don't go expecting that.

My advice is get there early and also get fast passes to the rides you are really interested in getting on. Be prepared to wait in line as Disneyland does get pretty crowded. Bring good walking shoes, sunscreen and bring a backpack to carry your things. Also, make sure you wear something comfortable. Another thing, bring a camera so you can take lots of pictures of the characters etc.",Disneyland_California,126

The best part was definitely being able to Fast Pass every major ride. Our longest wait was 15 minutes at the Indiana Jones ride, and that's on a day when Fast Passes sold out by noon, the park would not sell new passes after noon, and swarms of people were all around us.

We especially liked the Lion King show   it   s a cant miss show. One thing I was disappointed was HyperSpace mountain; it could   ve been much better than it is.

Fast pass was hit and miss, especially with kids rides like Buzz Lightyear and Crush's coaster.As for the parade and show, just follow the usual tips, grab a kerb side spot half hour before and don't budge (you'll need to be ruthless) other wise there'll be someone in front of you and you'll be looking at the back of someone's head.

Prices in the restaurants are really steep circa 80 Euros for a buffet lunch for two adults and two children. We also struggled to find pasta for our kids but could only get hot dogs, nuggets etc..Hotel New York was pretty decent..Personally I think Legoland in windsor does a better jon on a much smaller scale..Kids are very happy so makes the high cost just about worthwhile..",Disneyland_Paris,129

We really had to decide on which ride we felt was worth waiting to ride since all waits were about an hour or longer. Splash Mountain ride we were in line for two hours and during that time the ride was closed TWICE due to some failure in the system after that I was afraid to ride it so we left dissappointed as we lost A LOT of time waiting.

Disney need to look at the online fastpass system used in Orlando and have wifi in the parks (they promote the Disney App that gives wait times but don't have wifi).

Everything in Disneyland HK is as consistent and 'Disneyfied' as all of the other parks, just on a smaller scale! We went on the day before a public holiday and the longest we queued for a ride was 15 minutes which was awesome! Refreshments are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected. The evening firework show is a magical way to end a magical Disney day! I'd definitely recommend a visit if you are a kid at heart.",Disneyland_HongKong,127
266976263,5,2015-4,Australia,Family of mum dad and eleven year old boy had the whole day there. Got discount tickets when crossing the border. Food quite expensive inside but we did expect that. Loved toy story land the most. Went on a Friday and no queue at all for anything very quiet day. Took us a while to find the shop where you can get the Mickey Mouse ears with your name embroider on them as our son wanted. They are very cheap $60 and stitching free so very happy Worth the price as it was an amazing day Make sure you see the golden Mickey show and also the 3 d show great for a sit down rest and very entertaining 10 10 for both shows.,Disneyland_HongKong,124
301461917,5,2015-8,United Kingdom,A must for big kids with small kids !!! lol. We took our two girls aged 11 and 8. Went on every ride during our four park days! Park Must do's... Crush roller coaster ( go backwards) and ratatouille was amazing too. Take water bottles and refil at water fountains.. save a fortune on drinks. . Took the super concentrated squash in our bags too. Use fast past first thing as most big rides stop by 11.30! Book tickets through Attractiontix if you are a uk resident. Saved over   100 on park tickets.Park don'ts... queue for the welcome to the princesses that is currently on. It's only anna and eilsa from frozen on a horse and carriage! Nothing else. Go to the Frozen sing along in the chaparral theatre instead.. even my husband was singing!,Disneyland_Paris,135

So you didn't get to go on many rides in a day. The staff were down right rude and so unhelpful. We. We're are a group of 6 and we all commented when one person was actually pleasant. No Disney spirit I'm afraid. Even the children commented on how rude everyone was. Doesn't make for a fun day. The Disney Dream fireworks and display was very good, it was at 10.00 at night, but it was well done.We went 9 years ago and it was better then.

It tells you all the secrets of negotiating Disneyland. You put in the rides you want to do, and it spits out a schedule on how to do them. It is awesome. We were there on a crowded Saturday and we didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for any ride. We did virtually everything between the opening and about 6pm. Amazing!! I am an ANTI LINE WAITING person and this thing was the best $30 I've spent. Especially important when Disneyland is $500 for my family of 6. Of course, Disney does such a super job managing the park    that goes without saying.",Disneyland_California,127

Some do offer fast pass, do check it out so u dont have to waste time q  ing for it. Tips  if u are travelling with young children and first time to disneyland. Wld suggest that you stay at Disneyland hotel for a night or two before moving on to city hotels. Save on travelling time and is always a nice experience staying in disney hotels.

I caught the shuttle to the park for my birthday. I was able to purchase a locker to store my bags (about 7 euros). I will admit, I was not impressed with this park. It is the smaller of the Disney parks. However, I still had a good time even though it was extremely cold. I am not sure why but I didn't see any of the Disney princesses.

We went on a Friday and there was a crowd but we still managed to cover much of the park. I have been to Magic Kingdom Disney in Orlando and it took us 2 days. We felt satisfied with the HK Disney after one day because we had covered so much due to the lack of lines. The Lion King show was a highlight.

We managed to go through a park in a day, leaving us another two days to revisit our favourite rides and get our autographs, so our week visit (including travel) was perfect and there was loads to keep us busy.Characters were excellent, very much in character and seemingly genuinely very interested in making children smile.The variety of rides were fantastic and, although some were closed, there was something for everyone.Waiting times for some of the bigger rides were only 5 minutes and everything was very efficient, with the Disney Magic fireworks and lights display starting at the very second that it was expected.

The lines for the very few baby rides disallow strollers and clearly not one of the designers has ever tried to stand in line for 40 minutes with a toddler! Apart from It's a Small Small World , the shows and rides are frightening, especially in   dventure land, so you are reduced to the Fantasyland area where there are two main rides, that are almost impossible to access. Surely strollers can be parked at the end of the queue and not at the beginning? Also impossible to shop as there were too few cashiers and no one to assist on the floor, forcing clients to save questions for the cashier, thereby delaying the lines even more as the cashier had to run around finding correct sizes etc.",Disneyland_HongKong,134

In all the park has great rides, on stage shows, parades and fireworks but it suffers a bit from being the original park some areas are a bit confusing sometimes due the layout and expansions.

I would not go on the weekend too crowded. We saw and rode everything by getting fast pass for Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, but Pirates of the Caribbean was closed. It is not as big as California or Kissimmee Parks which makes it easier to see and do everything in a day including the parade. Take you own water or other beverages because they are very expensive in the park.

Always remember that one day is never enough, so plan it well, get your family ready and start having fun the moment you buy the tickets. Buy the tickets online or from your hotel concierge desk better than get it onsite. The activities there were so amazing with a chance to meet your favorite characters and have a photos with them. For Mickey an the Princes there was a long que but sure you gonna wait because of the huge smile that you will see in your kids face. All themes contains gift shops and restaurants with all what you need. All the kids were in Disney characters outfits and that was really nice.

The most waiting my friend and I had to do was, at the most, ten minutes.Before 9pm, people will start gathering by Main Street for the fireworks so you can easily get a ride all to yourself. No one else was riding RC Racer by that time so the cast members were kind enough to just let us sit on the ride instead of getting off every single turn!(My favourite rides were RC Racer, Mystic Manor and Grizzly Mountain!)It was an fun and excellent visit.

We visited the park for 2 days day one doing all rides and jedi temple. (This was a Wednesday and tge queues were 15mins max. On Thursday we concentrated more on shows, parades, fireworks and a few favourite rides it was much busier with wait time of 30   40mins.Fireworks were AMAZING.We visited for my son's birthday and he received a birthday badge to where, staff and characters very friendly wishing him happy birthday.",Disneyland_HongKong,129

The food was what we expected from the counter service restaurants, not five star, but good. Some rides were shut down for maintenance,which can happen at any park and we just went with the flow. Would recommend to download the Disney Paris app for your phone which give a lot of general information as well as schedules, what rides would be down, and info about places to stay and eat.

Our favourite rides were Space Mountain and the Golden mine ride rollercoaster. The one thing we were horribly disappointed in was the pathetic excuse of a castle. Only the bottom half is real and then there is just a cardboard like wall at the top. Looks very fake. We caught the MTR from Central Station (we stayed at 4 Seasons which is directly above that station) to Sunny Bay and then changed over to the Disney line. Much cheapier and easier than catching a trip, also faster. Overall it was a good day and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Hong Kong. Visited 9th Jan 2015",Disneyland_HongKong,130

The music shows are excellent, so when I needed a break from Mickey, I took in a show. My fav: Alladin and World of Color. Both were just wonderful! I have a gluten allergy...I dreaded eating in the park. Do not fear, fellow gluten free friends. Disney is the best! A chef always came and talked to me, if we ate at a 'sit down' restaurant. The walk up food was equally aware of gluten allergies. So not a hassle ever!

The first day we were able to get our fast passes in the morning and we got times for 9:30pm. Some of the staff at the restaurants were absolutely done and didn't provide good service. The second day we just gave up, most rides were out of passes. I'm happy to say we all came back measles free from the recent outbreak.

You'd think it was free after spending the day there. It's totally pathetic now. It had been about 10 years since I had last come and I recommend taking your kids to Hawaii for a family vacation.

The Matterhorn was closed the entire time we were there. We were really disappointed, since that is not available in FL. We were lucky that Indiana Jones opened the last day we went.

Favorites are always Big Thunder Mountain, the Matterhorn, Space Mountain, Star Tours. Unfortunately Indiana Jones was closed that day. One recommendation is to take time to do something other than a big attraction. We watched the flag retreat ceremony. You get to hear the Disneyland Band and the Dapper Dans.

Take a full day for this park, it can be crowded. As for Disney Studios, for us it does not offer a full days worth of activities.

The crowds will be smaller, the lines will be shorter, and the weather will be cooler. Going during the summer is the worst thing anyone can do because the park can get over capacity and the lines range from 1 2hr wait not to mention how hot it gets.

Food is probably expensive compared to other places in the US but reasonable compared to Sydney. Souvenirs I found very well priced. We went on all the rides and met all the characters. We took our 4 children aged 7 17 and I recommend waiting till your children are 6 years plus so they can fully enjoy it. I can't wait to go back again. Definitely the happiest place on earth.,Disneyland_California,127
286051777,5,2014-8,Sweden,"I went to Disney World a few weeks before I went here and it felt like this place is a combination of the parks in Disney World.For me it was more or less the same experience, just smaller.However, Disney is always Disney. Even though I felt like I already experienced all the rides and views in the park before, I still enjoyed it a lot.It's still an easy 5 star, even if Disney World is a class by itself.This place get really crowded so plan your visit in advance. But study the map it's easier to get to the rides before other people that usually have very long lines.There is also plenty of places to eat, from budget to expensive. I guess I don't have to mention that it's perfect for the whole family.",Disneyland_California,134
276014983,5,2015-5,United States,"This was our first trip to Disneyland and it was a surprise. The place is immaculate, every bush is trimmed and the people who work there are genuinely pleasant. We went on the Pirates of the Carribean, the space tour, the jungle ride, the submarine (which does not actually seem to submerge), the haunted mansion, etc. The crowds were not bad and with a little planning you could get a fastpass that worked very well. What did not work very well was the line for the jungle ride, way too long and complex. We had a very decent lunch. The weather was cool and clear, a great day to visit. There's an animation store which is very worthwhile. The best ride for me was the Space Tour, a vivid virtual reality ride and the best waiting area.",Disneyland_California,137
234867964,5,2014-5,United Kingdom,"I don't dislike anything, and I am honestly a very picky person. It is beautiful, safe, clean and most importantly magical! Visiting DLP I thought would be a once in a lifetime trip for me and the children, but it is so enjoyable I can't imagine not going at least once a year, although I think we will stop going and start saving for Florida now   just because that truly will be our once in a lifetime holiday and the children don't seem to be slowly down their pace of growth :( Rides are great, the cast members are very helpful also. I would like to see a log flume type ride, and better meal plan options as they are abit strange. ",Disneyland_Paris,122
584401460,2,2018-6,United States,"Oh boy. So crowded. Even on a Wednesday. Lots of rides broken or closed. Wait times ridiculous even using fast pass. Save yourself the peril and pick another destination. Tip if you do go , get there in the early morning 8:00 am. However if you do want to arrive early, stay at the resort, because LA traffic will be prohibitive. You   ll spend more this way. Catch 22! Park is 60 years old and has not expanded much, but attendance has tripled. Our kids 12 and 13 has about 0 fun. Really Disney? For these prices everything should be operational and you should not have time to eat your over priced lunch while waiting in line for a ride that may or may no work by the time you get to starting gate. UUGH",Disneyland_California,135
533854836,4,2017-10,United States,"Again as a Disney fan I say make a way to go! It   s pretty cheap to go this time of year and make sure to look for deals. My ticket was less than $50 not    . that   s an awesome deal! The park was beautiful! It seemed like there   s more to see but less rides than back in Anaheim. Some things were different like the Indiana Jones ride was an outdoor roller coaster instead. Pirates didn   t really have Captain Jack Sparrow until the end. The castle was prettier and the night show was good but the fireworks aren   t as good as the parks back in the US. And for some reason I think I prefer the Space Mountain ride here.What they didn   t have much of was single rider rides, only Space Mountain had it. ",Disneyland_Paris,139
577576671,5,2018-4,United Kingdom,"Being British and a gnarly old cynic, I wasn't too sure about having 3 days with Disney. Especially after the mega disappointing Universal Studios visit. However... it's fantastic! You can see that rather than hoovering up the money, it's spent on keeping you entertained throughout the day and The place clean and tidy. The parades, especially at night are incredible. We were lucky enough to be there during the Pixar Fest and you cannot take it all in in one go. Do stay for the fireworks and make use of the fastpass if rides are your thing. Also, the park hopper option makes sense, especially if you are there for more than a day. Food is good and varied. Not especially cheap, but comparable to restaurant prices. Go off peak if possible. Even in April, it was busy and hot.",Disneyland_California,140
550586322,3,2017-12,United Kingdom,"I've mentioned before how Disney stopped capping admissions to a reasonable level over the holiday season so visitors could enjoy what remains a wonderful place to visit. Their greed is ruining the place as to have to wait in line for ten minutes whilst in the park before being able to walk   sorry, shuffle   to the next attraction can't be anyone's idea of fun, surely? Of course holiday times will be busy and we expect that. But we don't expect a park that is simply overfull to the extent that in a full day there and despite Fast Passes and front of line access (we completed a questionnaire) we could only do four rides.When a day out at a theme park becomes a test of endurance it's no longer fun and is something to avoid.",Disneyland_California,135
167443424,5,2013-6,United States,"Well this was my second visit to Disney California, with a few years in between. I was glad to see the rides were updated to newer, and common thrillers like Tower of Terror. Also, for the 99%'ers, the Fast Pass system is a must for second helpings of your favorites.The park had a great new coaster, on the smooth track and wheels of modern coasters. The Car's section of the park was very nice, and had a great theme ride in it.My biggest disappointment was Space Mountain. The reason is I got larger and the cars didn't. Also the old chain and old track contributed to an extremely painful ride for me. So, if your back is bad believe the signs on that ride because smooth it is not ... just like when I was 11.

The parks are smaller than the California and Orlando's Disney's Parks but still thinking you need 1 day per park! Compre los tickets en l  nea (2 parques por el precio de uno como pudiendo ir de un parque a otro cuando quieras) pero definitivamente recomiendo un d  a por parque (son dos parques) porque en un d  a no alcanzas a aprovechar cada parque!

The Park was busiest on the Sunday getting quieter as we went through the week although the ride queues were never more than 45 minutes, most of the time 5 20 minutes was the norm. For the longer waits we used Fast Pass, probably 2 3 times per day, but as we had 5 days in the parks we easily done everything we wanted too. We stayed at the New York Hotel and the package included Half Board plus meal plan which we upgraded to Full Board, worth doing as the restaurants in the Park are expensive, I   d also recommend booking your lunchtime table in advance as the popular ones like Captain Jacks can get busy even when the Park is quiet.",Disneyland_Paris,137

Still the kids in the group with no experience of bigger and better ones were wide eyed. Somehow got the idea that there were mostly foreign tourists on package tours where this Disneyland was one attraction promised to them. But inspite of so many foreigners, the variety of food available is extremely limited and very pricy too.Our grouse is that number of activities were either dysfunctional or had been shut down for whatever reason. Waiting time further deprives many of the prime experiences to those on a day tour. On the whole recommended for those who have not been to US ones. Those who have been will be tad disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris,129

As a big Walt Disney fan, Disneyland has a special place in my heart because it meant so much to Walt and he was there every step of the way. His apartment where he lived during the construction is above the fire station on main street. There is a light that you will see on in the window which has a special meaning. When Walt was alive and would visit the park, they would turn that light on to let the staff and patrons know he was in the area. They now have that light on all the time as his spirit is always there ;) It's a lovely, magical place where you can leave your problems and worries outside and just be a kid for the day.",Disneyland_California,138

After visiting disney florida in 2007 we had a idea of what to expect, but not for the 1 hour wait to take a 1 minute 30 second ride, and getting wet not all under cover. The plus side was a lot of the disney shows are good and the castle lights show was the best ever seen .We stayed bat the Santa fFe hotel the room was ok but breakfast was the worst experience ever it was like camping plastic plates and a cheap continental breakfast and not enough room to sit down,We will go over the water in future to America",Disneyland_Paris,125
335337121,5,2015-12,Australia,Whats not to love about this place. You come here expecting to queue and you do. Not a lot of just standing though as the lines keep moving. Use the quick pass system where you can. This allows you to generate a ticket for a particular ride and give you a time to return and bypass most if not all of the queue. The only negative thing I have to say is that there is not a decent coffee to be found in the place. Please America understand that not every one drinks filter coffee!!. Stay for the parade if you can as it is great and use the railway to quickly move around the park to the area you want.....particularly Tomorrowland which is very busy at the moment due to all the starwars happenings. ,Disneyland_California,135

I found this Disney park poorly maintain compared to the one in Hong Kong or Paris. We paid more than 500$ for a family of 5 and seriously it's not worth it at all!!Staff service is average, most of food proposed is over priced and poor quality.Well for me I will say Disney is not made to have happy family but to robe family!Honestly spend your money traveling with your kids on the beach or visit natural parks, this is cheaper and more fun!!One positive, carpark over there is good...but cost you 18$!",Disneyland_California,134
269866361,4,2015-5,United States,"I went mainly because as a 65  senior the admission was HK$100, roughly US$12.90. In the USA, admission is over $100. Clearly, this is not California or Florida. The park is small and has a few shortcomings, primarily the fact that several buildings on Main Street as well as Cinderella's Castle, are crude plywood with the scenes painted on. It looks cheap and silly. Surely Disney animators could have done better.With that said, the park was well laid out, clean and well organized. The Lion King show was excellent, although a bit intense for small children.As always, Disney rips you off on food, although Dim Sum at HK$30 for four pieces was reasonable as was a 700ml water for HK$25,The park is easy to reach on MTR and is well worth a visit since lines were never very long.",Disneyland_HongKong,139

The attractions she could go on we're limited so the trip was not as frenetic as past trips with our sons. The food at each of the events we attended was very good and while the service was not quite of the American standard it was good and probably better than the UK. The only slightly negative comment we would make was that we attempted to see the fireworks and closing show on three separate nights but she was not able to stay awake despite later starts and early evening naps. That said, it was probably our disappointment rather than hers but and earlier show would have been nice. Recommended for a bit of escapist fun. ",Disneyland_Paris,130

The staffs are really friendly with everyone, and give you a hand if your lost or need assistance or advice. You don't need tickets for rides you just pay a pass and can be there all day, Since i got a three day pass i was there for three days. The space mountain and Indiana Jones rides were awesome , I got to see mickey mouse and other dressed up in the whole park, really the best place to spend your childhood.",Disneyland_California,128
13919992,4,missing,United States,I went to disneyland a few times when I was young and don't remember enjoying it all that much. I was skeptical but my two and a half year old wanted to go. I am very glad we did. It was crowded even in the middle of the week during slow season but we had more fun than we have anywhere else. My son loved the rides and felt so big being able to go on quite a few. We went on buzz Lightyear six times in two days. The food wasn't as badly priced as other theme parks and it was amazingle clean. The only thing that was a little disappointing is that there didn't seem to be as many characters as there used to be. Other than that it was a wonderful experience.,Disneyland_California,135
284889336,5,2015-6,Australia,"No one knows how to do things like Disney! The park istelf is great, so many rides and things to do   and not just for the kids. Only drawback is the wait time in a lot of the attractions, although fast pass does make things a little easier in some cases. Maybe a 'single rider' line like they have at Universal would be something to consider to make wait times less. Some of the rides broke down (frequently) which was a bit of a bummer, but on the whole it was a fun, fantastic experience. Don't miss the Fantasmic show or the parades, they are well worth seeing.

I would recommend allocating at least 2 days to see everything, the parks are huge and the lines can get long. Google when is the best time visit. Generally during the week is better. Make use of the fast pass options. You can even pre book lunch and dinner reservations, download the phone app and you can even see ride wait times. The mornings are better, so be there for opening, late afternoon the lines can be really long. It is an expensive exercise, but worth it at least once! So much to do and see.

Food is also great at the restaurants that don't require reservations. You can't miss the parade at 7 PM and firework show at 11 PM. Just be careful not to lose your park tickets!

Over $400 for family tickets for the one day). We went over to Knotts Berry Farm for the first time, much cheaper and offer more of that thrill seeker roller coaster experience our teenager desired. Of course, Disney park gets crowded, hot and expensive to eat in the park, but that should be a given. Learn to use the rider app or go  single rider  to enjoy the popular rides.

However, everything else about Disney is very impressive! Each different area is very special, the rides are fun and the shops are quirky although slightly over priced! We also went to the museum with the A. Lincoln area which we found really good. The fireworks were amazing and if you miss staying to the end to see them you would miss out!

By 2pm the fast pass return time was often MIDNIGHT, and the wait times were 90  minutes for the big rides.

Made a reservation to meet the princess and saw Belle, who was absolutely lovely to the children and we had loads of photos taken with her. Also went to Mickey's clubhouse and met Mickey Mouse didnt feel rushed on meeting any of the characters.

The cost is inordinate  from the entrance to the food to the junk (aka souvenirs). Glad my son understands prices and budgets. The one quote on this topic that will stick with me was from some poor dad: I just paid $14 for 4 small bottles of water, and $16 for 4 churos.

Avoid the busiest times of the year if you do have a wheelchair user in your party, as they can get jostled and stressed by the crowds. Strollers are a constant pain in the ankles so watch out!

You could tell they are very into their characters however at Disney Land they seem to be a grumpy, have an attitude and generally just not care. Besides that the parade and the firework show was awesome! We had a great time we just weren't impressed by the service which is what I thought Disney was all about. ",Disneyland_California,139

Not acting like they used to with the kids. The first time I went Disney was 10 years ago and have been nearly twice a year since. Not going to bother next year, gone completely down hill. Met another family and they were saying they had nearly just had their bag pinched and another family that said it   s awful! Hotel Cheyenne is absolutely freezing including the water!

To be honest the longest lines were for Space Mountain (80 minutes) and the Starbucks. If you   ve been to Disney World   s the Magic Kingdom you will find this park to be very similar. The huge bonus to me was it was August and there was no humidity. There are rides here hat have been opened since the park opened back in 1955. Also some of these rides don   t exist anywhere else so that   s pretty awesome. Lastly, the park is not that big so you can do multiple laps around the place and stay under 5 miles.

It met all our expectations. Even with crowds and line ups,we had a wonderful time. California adventure park was less fun, because the roller coaster was closed for renos. The overwhelming throngs of stroller traffic is strange and the screaming children too young to enjoy the benefits is a bit daunting. I saw lots of frazzled parents of unhappy toddlers and infants. I recommend waiting till kids are at least 7 or 8 to really enjoy the parks.We had taken all our children at least once to the parks, and this final trek with a teenager was excellent.",Disneyland_Paris,126

We visited 10 years ago and it was great. Now it is awful. If you want to go to Chav City then this is the place for you. Everything is overpriced   if it were of good quality then it would be worth paying a premium. Planet Hollywood was truly terrible.

The parades and fireworks are great. This time of year use to be a slow time of year, but now with all of the Halloween celebrations at the park it is a busy time of year.

The only dampner was the torrential rain that drowned us as the parade started but in true Disney style the parade still went on and was fantastic. One of our favourite memories is Pinocchio splashing us when he jumped in a puddle. Food was expensive but that's to be expected so next time we'll take our own.

I'd advise going for the more expensive hotels rather than the Cars themed one which is decidedly sub par. We had a meal at the Cars Mexican Cantina and underwhelmed is being kind... The better hotels are very good though. The magic of Disney is still there. The fireworks at night are excellent and the rides are pretty much identical to those in the US. It's just that the weather is not nearly as good so be prepared because your kids will insist on staying in the park even though you are freezing!,Disneyland_Paris,122

But please be sure to enquire the hotel staff for the view. There's also many shops inside selling many souvenirs which is what I like the most about! However, you can't bring certain things inside such as beer etc etc. (They will check your bag before you can make your entrance, which is a bit troublesome.)

We went for three days in October 2013, and it was the best three days that we have ever had on vacation. The park is so clean, lines were not that long at all (highly recommend a ride FASTPASS for the rides that have them available), and all of the park employees were so friendly).

I think that is completely ignorant and the Disney employees do nothing to stop this. Overall my daughter and I love Disneyland, I would rather not come at Peak season.

Being able to go inside auroras castle is incredible and see her story. Favourite ride had to be space mountain or it   s a small world. Both rides are a must do! I enjoyed (maybe too many) candy apples at   4 each. Slightly overpriced but super yummy. I wouldn   t visit again purely for the fact that once you   ve done it once that   s kind of it.

Then you line up for security, then to get on the cart to take you to the entrance, then to enter the park. Then comes the wait times for the rides.

The evening show with fireworks and projection on the castle is really impressive!You need at least 2 days to visit fully the park, also great to combine with Disney Studio   then at least 3 days are needed!And do not hesitate to bring a stroller for kids, our son is 5 years old but we walked almost 8km each day and he was really happy he could sit down in between!",Disneyland_Paris,133

These closures made me wonder at what point Disney feels obligated to lower ticket prices because not all attractions are available. Obviously, ride closures don't stop anyone as it was crowded. We had trouble finding open quick service restuarants one night and the few that were open had long lines.

The day we went was not crowded and not hot, which makes a big difference. In USA, they open the gates early, however, they do not do it here.

The park is worth visiting for anyone who has been touched by Disney. You will feel like you have stepped into a different world!But it is not a 5 5 experience. There are a number of attractions that are dated by modern standards and feel distinctly 1990s, breaking the immersion on occasion.

And the cost for food, merchandise and even a bottle of water was ridiculous! The park is still really clean and it has lots to see and do but you are very limited to what you'll experience due to the huge amount of people wanting to experience the same thing.

To maximise the number of attraction you can visit, take the left turn into Adventureland after main street and finish off Grizzly and Mystic Manor early as most of the crowd rushes to Disney Castle or Tomorrowland.To maximise the parade, sit at the roundabout at the end of main street, directly facing the castle.

The food served was terrible and overpriced. We stayed for two nights at the Disney New York Hotel. This was OK. But we were promised two hours exclusive time in the park every morning for Hotel guests. When we turned up, the main areas for teenage kids were not open.

The material was peeling of the back and stand, the paint work looks like it's been done by a toddler with a crayon, and the general quality of the product is just disgraceful.I would advise in future you review the quality of the products for sale in your resort shops, to avoid further disappointment.

The people who longed to see Donald, Pluto, Chip'n'Dale or their Star Wars heroes are no children anymore. Thrill seekers are better off with e.g. Europa Park. The management has clearly realized the problem and tries to introduce new attractions   good thinking. Still, value for money is currently average at best, as the prices remain higher than the competitors come up with, and there is clearly some catching up to do. Just do not miss Indiana Jones, Star Tours, the Parade, get lucky with the Big Thunder Mountain queue and lack of closures (they happen often) and you will have a fine day.

The park was spotless and there's loads of helpful staff. The Star Wars bit made me feel like a kid again, especially meeting chewbacca, boba fett & kylo ren. Even the kids said it was cool.

They had all the great rides that all the Disney parks have, other than pirates of the Caribbean and splash mountain. It was a bit disappointing not having a water ride in HK, considering how hot it is. Two things that disappointed us was that we really struggled to find vegetarian meals that were dairy free (allergies) and the merchandise wasn   t great. We didn   t buy any merchandise.

Buzzlightyear ride, autotopia, Matterhorn twice, toon town, dumbo, Big thunder 3 times, pirates, jungle cruise, tea cups, storybook ride and carousel. Watched the 8:45pm light parade, very beautiful but not as creative as past years. It was our first time seeing fireworks at the park, we usually avoid them but couldn't get out in time.

Would have been good to see what rides they had before entering as we may have preferred disneyland adventure park rides? W went on a weekday but the lines were still crazy.

When we visited the lines were not too long and we used fast passes as much as we could. We purchased a 2 day pass   one for Disneyland and one for California Adventure.

The park is clean tidy and has a great atmosphere, with Christmas music blaring out and constant shows with everyone's favourite characters it was incredible. My only complaint is that the characters no longer walk about the park and take pictures, you have to queue for a very long time but this is made up for by the illumination show on the castle at night.

Though spectacular we were pushed shoved by other guests, yelled at by staff then made to sit on the concrete for two hours.

Started the day with 3 or 4 runs through Space Mountain since there were no lines. We spent more time getting from the end of the ride than waiting in line. It started to clog up early in the afternoon, but still no more than 15 minute waits except for the boat ride (30 45 minutes).

Visit Mickey in toon town but be prepared to queue.Our kids love roller coasters but the scary noises and monsters on the Matterhorn left them shaking and fearful of other rides.

There a couple of rides here that aren't in Florida or Paris so thought we'd be in for a slightly different day out. Unfortunately the Indiana Jones ride was being refurbished and the mine train, which is fab in the other Disney parks, had a fault. The queues were long as always and we waited on average an hour per ride. It's always expensive here but you don't come here and expect anything else, so bring a packed lunch and a drink each to cut costs. We're a family of 5 and it's expensive to buy snacks from Disney.

Don't miss Soaring Over California, Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, and the Small World ride. The staff here is super friendly and the park is immaculate (you don't even see people cleaning it up, it just is clean) The food is expensive (of course) and just okay. The shops have some really nice things. If you stay later in the day, the lines are minimal and you can get on many more rides quickly. All in all, I can't wait to go back!",Disneyland_California,126

They have a system of fastpasses where essentially you book to come back later even with this system we waited half an hour when we came back, and many of the attractions have horrendous queues but fast passes aren't available or some sell out by lunchtime so you never get to do it  they need a better system!

So much to see and do and don't think we achieved up to 10% as we were only there for a day. Do whatever you can to get fast passes! We were on a queue for a ride for almost 2 hours! The ride was worth it though! Also do as much as you can to keep a firm grip on your kids as it's easy for them to get lost in the midst of the crowd within seconds.

Going in I was expecting 1 2 hour wait for the rides but only ended up being 15 20 if even , for the popular ones which was a huge plus. The only negative would be that some of the attractions were closed but I suppose they need renovation at some stage. The firework display at the end is not to be missed and overall would highly recommend anyone to visit. Only negative would be the food it   s overpriced and lack for a better word just terrible.

Sure food in the park is spendy, and the lines are crazy long, and there's a ton of people. But the sheer fact that you are wondering amongst Sleeping Beauty's castle, Davvy Crockett's stomping grounds, or Mickey Mouse's home definitely overrides that. Nothing beats a Disney parade or fireworks show and can we please just talk about the amazingness that is Dole Whips?? Nothing beats Disneyland.

It wasn't overly busy so we didn't have to wait long. The only let down was the food which wasn't very pleasant.

76753310,4,missing,United States,Disneyland is still best of the breed but it is an expensive place. The entry price is quite expensive. We didn't buy tickets in advance and discovered that they had 'blocked out' the discount for locals and didn't offer discount for AAA membership at the park. Also we discovered that you have to pay extra to get into the adjacent and smaller Disney California Adventure which is right by the Disneyland entrance. A big disappointment is the additional costs. For example parking is $15 per day. Food and refreshments are very expensive (e.g. $18 for 2 hot dogs and two small cokes). The quality of meals on site sometimes leaves a lot to be desired   the $14 chicken lunch was like bad dorm food. Kids still love Disney. The staff are mostly very helpful and very friendly.,Disneyland_California,137

The park was well connected and queues seemed to be handles very well and efficiently.The waiting times varied, but this is expected at parks anyways!

Best option is to get fast passes which help but be prepared to still queue especially for the ratatouille and nemo rides. There are plenty of toilets around the park and quite clean. The negetive side to the park is that the food stands are quite rare and unhealthy. Also the some of the rides kept breaking down and the ratatouille break down several times in two days. It is especially hard to find coffee stands also for some reason which was surprising.,Disneyland_Paris,123

When we complained to Guest Services we got a lot of excuses and one rude clerk sarcastically told my daughter that she was welcome to follow around maintenance while they checked the measuring devices.

Space mountain is a thrilling roller coaster compared to the carnival ride it is in Florida. Pirates of the Caribbean, a thematic and beautiful adventure, ending with a sharp, dark drop, unlike its counterpart in the states which is a more of a tour. I'd recommend heading here in december, before the holidays, to take full advantage of the 5 10 minute wait times on all rides at that time.

Tip: go get a fast pass for Indian Jones as soon as you get into the park   that line tends to be one of the longest.

Crowds take a while to build, and you can avoid some really long lines by going directly between the bigger rides early on. As with all things Disney, the parking is super well organised, we booked a parking ticket online in advance, you get told exactly where to park and then shuttled to the park on small train type vehicles, all very straightforward. For eating options, it is no longer a case of all things with chips, there were healthy options and the salads were particularly good.

Better spread over 3 to 4 days if you have kids in tow. Best value to buy tickets in advance, or if you go more than 5 days in a year, it's better to buy an annual pass available on site.

On the plus side it has lovely shops and Frontierland has a lovely atmosphere especially at night.

The windows are in the form of Mickey's head, the hanging bands (what are they called? you hold on to them while the train is moving) are Mickey's hands holding the band, and there is something like a gallery in each train..Lots for kids (and adults!) to see inside the train.

145828793,5,2012-11,United States,"I've visited Disneyland several times since it originally opened in the '50s. This is an outstanding theme park. It is very well maintained   meaning very clean. The rides are still great but I miss 'E Tickets'!! The only downside is that tickets are relatively expensive. The good news is that the ticket includes all rides and attractions (no need for an 'E Ticket'). I was not impressed with the food offered inside the park. Again, it is relatively expensive and not that good. On the day we were there, the park was not that busy so we were able to do everything we wanted to do. On busy days, you may not be able to do that and you should plan for an extra day.",Disneyland_California,125

The most courteous staff and woah this place is like a heaven not only for kids who grew up watching the magic created by Mr.Walt Disney but also for their parents who use to exercise their parental powers to stop their children from spending too much of time in front of that idiot box, lol. From the rides, to the shows, to the restaurants( we found ourselves   Indian food ^ ^ ) . Disneyland did a really great thing by installing water coolers next to the toilets at every corner of the park. Not punching a hole in the pockets of the tourists. And on top of that the firework show that happens every night at 9 is pretty intense and captivating. MUST GO   Highly Recommended!",Disneyland_HongKong,130

We had a great time here, but compared to Paris, Tokyo and Florida (the others I've visited) it was very small with a limited number of rides and no real thrill rides. Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park.

Once visited Disney in Hong Kong and noticed a difference of not too many characters walking around. A lot of my old favourites like Donald Duck not to be seen. Thinking it was the time of year their not so busy (if u can say that seemed packed) some of the worlds were closed for maintenance like the paddle steamer etc BUT they have to maintain at sometime for safety. Hate to see what it is like Peak season. Guessing this is why I rated 4 star.

While in the park, one show was cancelled five minutes before it was supposed to start (we waited in line for 30 minutes), rides were closed due to technical difficulties. The food was partially disappointing. And Disney advertised Halloween themed decorations. There wasn't much of that. I was very disappointed, since I love Halloween and expected Disney to go all out. The Europapark in Rust, Germany does a way better job and Halloween doesn't have a real tradition in Germany.We wrote a letter of complaint to Disney's customer service, but never heard back. In 2015 our experience was better for the 75th anniversary, but I don't think we will be back to the park anytime soon. ",Disneyland_California,140

But if you want to take advantage of this and spectate Disneydreams, (sound, lights and fireworks show at the castle) you've fourteen and a half hours to fill. Now it should be fun, fun, fun all the way, but with young people getting increasingly fidgety by the minute the wait times for many of the attractions can be exhausting. Fast Pass tickets certainly seem to speed things up, but we couldn't help but feel a timed ticket system would be fairer, allow you to stroll, refresh or do something else and save a lot of hanging around.

The park was quiet in the am and some evenings as well. Staff were friendly and the photographers were amazing! We made good use out of our photopass from the maxpass. Well worth the money. Loved the Christmas decorations and the overall holiday atmosphere in both parks. By using the app and maxpass I feel we optimized our time in the park to the best of our ability and walked away feeling like we accomplished what we wanted to do. We were lucky and there were not too many ride closures and most that happened were very temporary. Looking forward to coming back to the park again sometime. ,Disneyland_California,140

I was a chaperone for the majority of the trip, and I really looked forward to going to Disneyland. Although the girls who went with me were good sports, I could tell they didn't enjoy the park very much. The rides were not exciting enough without huge, high speed rollercoasters.

Still got to see and do everything we wanted to, but that was only because we have been many times, and therefore skipped parts that we knew we didn't care about. We were there for seven hours, and were able to ride Thunder Mountain, Guardians, Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Haunted Mansion.

Everything was lovely and pleasant. The restaurant fast food could be improved though. But we loved the food carts. The only thing that was unpleasant was the attitude of some of the people from the Mainland. Even though a line was evident, they still shoved and tried to squeeze their way in front of the lines.

If you take the Euro rail it drops you off at the gates or you can take a shuttle to your hotel from there. You must see the nightly fireworks laser show which is spectacular and so much better than Disney Lands or Disney Worlds. On the down side we did come across a few rude French folks and the toilets in Disney Paris smell pretty bad and are not as clean as you would think a Disney bathroom should be.

I am glad I came to the park and had the opportunity to see the attractions, ride the various rides and see the shows.

But the experience was all about the 8 & 9 year olds who were in their element. While the adults just love the experience of the entire park including the arcades and the La Tani  re du Dragon.

Some attractions really need updates (yes, Tiki Room, I'm talking to you). Lots of things down for refurbishment at Tomorrowland. Place has serious deferred maintenance issues. But they can make up for it with staff quality. And there are lots of good ones. And too many surly ones for a place like Disney. They are holding on. But not likely to return for a good, long while.

Food and drinks in park are really expensive so we always eat lunch there and then go to McDonald's right outside the park for a late dinner. Always use the fastpass when you can.

Disney makes sure everyone has as much fun as possible. My advice is to arrive early, an hour before the park opens. There is a long wait to get in the gate, but once you are inside the wait for rides is short for the first few hours. After that, take advantage of FastPasses. The busiest time is the afternoon, so you can always leave to take a nap and then go back later in the evening. The best rides are the most popular ones, so ride them early.

Captain EO has definitely run it's course but the Small World ride was much better than Magic Kingdom and Indiana Jones, Matterhorn and Finding Nemo attractions were all must see's. The fireworks show was great as usual and could be seen clearly anywhere in park.When it comes to customer service and efficiency no one does it better than Disney and we had such a great time.

It was tasteless and stomach cramps ensued shortly after the meal. It was $35 for two meals. I will say the availability of fresh fruit and healthy snacks was great.

Sure, the shows are good (Lion King is still one of the best show) but there is just nothing special that makes you want to stay anytime longer. With the recent price increase, I do not think is a worth the time and money to visit. (I think the money is better spend on foods in Hong Kong)",Disneyland_HongKong,121

We arrived first thing and was there until close, spending much of the day park hoping between disneyland and california adventure. Highlights for me included the night parade and splash mountain, unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled due to weather. Make sure you make use of the fast passes to ensure you maximise your visit. We were here for only 1 day, which was enough however we easily could've had two. You can also get free  first visitor  badges from town hall as you enter, or a birthday free badge if someone you are travelling with if having their birthday.

We visited in early October and the park was extremely crowded because of the holiday season for the Chinese new year. Wait times for nearly every ride was about one hour but that did not stop us. Fastpass was available for a few rides and we took advantage of it. The park is quite small when compared to the properties in Florida & California. Had lunch at the main food court and options were limited. Kids were disappointed that the parade was cancelled because of threat of thunderstorms. Overall, it was a great day at Disney and we will keep coming back. There was an hour wait at the taxi stand to get back to the city.",Disneyland_HongKong,140

Food isn't as pricey in the park as you might expect   just keep hydrated and keep your energy up   you'll need it.Arrive at opening and stay until close   catching the Paint the Night Parade, Fantasmic and the fireworks.

Very limited options for a Indian vegetarian (only one restaurant has a limited menu). Non Vegetarian food is available in aplenty. Carry sandwiches, water, an umbrella for the kids, it helps as they tire from all the walking. Wait lines are grueling at times, with show wait times being almost half n hour. Iron Man attraction is the latest addition to come up next year. Grizzly is a must go to ride. Meet & greet with the characters was fun, look for timing as given in the park schedule.

It was very easy to get to on the Disneyland Express train. The attractions were well maintained and the queues well managed. Sleeping Beauty's castle was disappointing small and there were not many indoor thrill rides. Many outdoor rides more suited for children. Universal Studios in Singapore had better indoor thrill rides, and more entertaining. The food and merchandise were 'reasonably priced', for a theme park that is.

However the line waits were much much shorter!! I think since WDW has more space than DL that's why I felt the DL was super crowded. But we rode everything! Our longest wait was 25 minutes. We would get a fastpass for the rides with the longer lines. And those fastpass times were only about an 30 min 1hour wait. So we'd get the FP, ride something else nearby with a low wait, then use our FP. Then we could get another FP and repeat the process. The park was open late but we had done everything by 6PM.

But if you're not into that, there's something for you.My biggest tip for everyone: Don't book through their official website. I found the exact same deal on travel republic for almost   300 cheaper. Shop around and find the best magical stay for you.

Yeah, it's crowded, and their are lines, but if the worst part of your day is waiting on a line getting ready to enjoy a ride with your whole family, or deciding which ride everyone can go on next, then really how bad of a day can it be. It's a special place where you can enjoy the rides as much as your kids, and even if you don't have kids yet, it can actually be oddly romantic.

Then there was the Disney dreams parade with all the characters which my youngest especially enjoyed. Although be warned the song will get stuck in your head!, haha.

That lest enjoy the rest of the day and take our time. We signed up for Max pass for the first time and highly recommend it. It saves you a lot of time from having to walk to go get a fastpass. And you can do more than one at a time after i think 1.5 hours after you reserved the last one. It was nice being able to download your ride photos. The best was being able to order food from some of the restaurants and it being ready and paid for when you get there. Can't wait for Star Wars to open!,Disneyland_California,137

It's always better to decide the priority rides and go with the map. A lot of crowd assembled for the parade and illumination show so better take your seat at least half an hr before it. Have your dinner early as we were not able to find anything at 9pm. Most of the food outlets were closed by that time. Illumination show is just amazing. You can't even skip it for a second.

On Main Street there are some great places to eat, drink and shop.

Once you do this for all rides you can plan your day around the place and reach the rides at that time to directly walk in rather than waiting in an hour long queue for a 5min ride.

The opening and closing parades   processions were most enjoyable and the fireworks at 8.30 in the night was the crowning glory of the tour. Highly recommended to all visitors to Hong Kong!",Disneyland_HongKong,133

631595181,4,2018-3,India,"Visited in March 2018 on a Sunday. Due to weekend, there were too many visitors and long queue for all the rides   attractions. Had to skip several rides due to their long waiting time. However, whatever rides we took, most of these were not that thrilling. There were 2 parades on that day, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Both were fun to watch, especially the evening parade with illumination was very attractive. There were no closing fireworks, told that it had been discontinued. There are restaurants inside the park, however foods were expensive and average in taste. It is an expensive affair; entry tickets, inside food etc. all are overpriced. Though at the end it was tiring, but overall it was a fun filling day spent at HK Disney Land.",Disneyland_HongKong,134
267850693,5,2015-4,United Kingdom,"Really enjoyed our time here. We only had a 26 hour stop off in Hong Kong so decided to go and stay in Disney as it was close to the airport(and I love Mickey!)It is obviously smaller than the other parks but it is perfectly formed. It definitely had the feeling of Disney, someone has trained all the staff very well in Disneyness!Also there were enough differences to keep us entertained and surprised. The lines could have been slightly better managed and it was quite amusing to watch the crowds squeeze forward every time the host told us how long we had left to wait and then when the barrier was lifted they actually ran to the open doors!But everything was very enjoyable",Disneyland_HongKong,123
167884654,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,We took our 6 year old granddaughter for a few days. The park is a little girl's dream! Very busy and long queuing times for most rides but always something going on to keep the kids happy. Best part for all of us was the parades and firework displays at the end of the night is amazing. Meeting Snow White and having her picture taken with her was another highlight for our girl. Although I was surprised that we didn't see too many characters walking about but could be we just missed them. The parks are spotless and have several places to eat which although not cheap were much the same as any other theme park.Definitely would recommend going but you need to take plenty of spending money!! ,Disneyland_Paris,128
217127150,4,2014-7,Australia,Disneyland as expected was great. Fastpass is the way to go and you can get these fro free. Arrive early and do the major rides before 11 than check out all the fastpass times. Get your passes (the rides show the times) and go from ride to ride with no queue. Great performing arts theatre for lunch with beautiful menu selections which were big   buy less meals than you think you will need. Ride breakdowns were disappointing specially after queuing to find the ride had to close when you were almost there ( this happened on day 1 before we knew about fastpass) but the staff were good and did issue passes to come back at anytime without queuing. The kids were wowed,Disneyland_Paris,123
213397939,4,2014-5,Australia,"I hadn't been to Disneyland for 46 years, so it has certainly changed in that time..... now I know where the term  Disney queues  comes from !! there were certainly queues queues and more queues, and you just have to be patient.... We were there end of May, so I would imagine winter would be a better time..... some of the rides were out of operation, and we were on a log when Splash Mountain broke down not a nice experience to have to be rescued half way an incline, but the staff were excellent and we were given a fast lane pass when it started operating again.All in all I still loved the experience of just being at Disneyland.",Disneyland_California,120
269587323,4,2015-3,United Kingdom,"Having to pay 210 euros just to enter was extortion! Also, having to wait for over an hour for a ride completely put me off riding anything. I did my best to avoid any rides as it was just way too long. I did however find the place incredible and magical. I visited the animation studio and the car racing but we we're told we were unable to leave by a lady.... which once again we wasn't too happy about. It's a family day out, not a prison. It was nice to be surrounded by all things animation and was a nice day out but wouldn't return. I would still recommend anybody who has quite a bit of money to spend to visit though.",Disneyland_Paris,124
120248653,5,2011-11,United States,"We try to visit Disneyland annually while in town to visit family. This year we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and bought the 4 day hopper pass to the parks. Disneyland is great during the week and during off peak months. We went to the park Tuesday  Friday. We were able to walk on the rides with close to no wait times. As the crowds come in the wait times increased to no more than 20 minutes and the busiest rides. We had a great time. We may not buy the 4 day pass again as this was a little too much time in the parks but I think 3 days is perfect to visit both parks and really enjoy all the rides, shows, parades and events. The staff is great and helpful. Can't wait to go again next year!",Disneyland_California,140
320701474,5,2015-10,United States,"Mickey's Halloween Party! Wow! I will be back for this!!! Get tickets early they sell out! So nice when adults get to dress up too! The whole park is decorated so beautifully for Halloween with fantastic halloween projections all over the main street buildings. The Haunted Mansion is decked out as   Nightmare Before Christmas . I really encourage Disney to keep the Haunted Mansion this way year round! The Space Mountain ride is also revamped for Halloween! So much fun! They have areas where you can trick or treat for candy! Yep, adults you get to trick or treat too! The wait for rides was fairly short. I wanted 5 minutes for Haunted Mansion, 20 for Space Mountain, 15 for Thunder Mountain, 10 for Pirates of the Caribbean. ",Disneyland_California,128
427745188,5,2016-9,Australia,GET THERE!Make sure you get an early access pass so as you can get on an hour early it really helps if you are interested in doing all the good rides.Go straight to Tomorrowland and do the Star Wars ride and then work around all the big rides as quick as possible. Make use of the fast passes as much as possible later in the day as the queues for some rides such as pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana jones get very long   but try and get them all done at least once early in the morning when queues are small.If you can get your kids their when they are small DO IT   it truly is a magical place for little ones and I feel bad for not getting my late teenage kids there earlier. ,Disneyland_California,136
223894526,3,2014-8,United States,"We did a day trip from Paris, very easy to get to, just 45 minutes on the RER A from Nation station in Paris. Drops you off right at the door. The general feel is that it's Disney, but missing something.... the constant smile from the disney cast members, the quick ride turn around and spotlessness that you expect from Disney. For example, we rode the carousel twice. It is a 30 second or 1 minute ride. It took seven minutes to load! Cast members chatting, dawdling, etc. I am surprised that Disney corporation hasn't expected more of them. It was a good day trip, and if you haven't been to Disney World, you may think it's great...but otherwise, it's just average.",Disneyland_Paris,122
200496607,3,2014-4,Belgium,"Long story short: this is really nice for the children. It's like a dream for them to meet the Disney caracters and to see the Disney Parade. The parc is really well organized and clean. Everything is done to help the public to find something to do...but:Sometimes it's really a pain to wait in the line 45 min and to do a 2 min attraction ride. Really!?So if you have children able to wait so long for so few, ok.So my best advice it's to go there when you can be sure that the parc will be half empty!!When it's full you have to wait for everything (except the toilets, thanks God)..If you go there without children for some sensations, be prepared to wait 1h00 for the best attractions so in one day if you're lucky you can do 4....",Disneyland_Paris,140
319657651,3,2015-10,Australia,"people will always go to Didneyland.for those going for the first time be prepared for huge crowds and line ups for up to an hour or more for the popular rides.we were there in october and it was so crowded it was almost unmanageable.having said that most people seemed to take in their stride.tip,drink lots of water and take frequent rest stops.ok everyone has their favorite attractions,to see most of them you would need at least 3 full days their,with small kids a big ask,i would recommend at least a 5 day pass,which allows multiple entry to all parks,this way you can go in morning return to hotel for a rest and hit the parks again at night.what ever attractions you do a must see is the electric light parade and fireworks.",Disneyland_California,132
